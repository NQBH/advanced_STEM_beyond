\subsection{Wikipedia{\tt/}discrete mathematics}
``{\it Discrete mathematics} is study of \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_structures}{mathematical structures} that can be considered ``discrete'' (in a way analogous to \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_variable}{discrete variables}, having a \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bijection}{bijection} with $\mathbb{N}$) rather than ``continuous'' (analogously to \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_function}{continuous functions}). Objects studied in discrete mathematics include integers, \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(discrete_mathematics)}{graphs}, \& \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statement_(logic)}{statements} in \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_logic}{logic}. By contrast, discrete mathematics excludes topics in ``continuous mathematics'' e.g. real numbers, calculus or \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_geometry}{Euclidean geometry}. Discrete objects can often be \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enumeration}{enumerated} by integers; more formally, discrete mathematics has been characterized as branch of mathematics dealing with \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Countable_set}{countable sets} (finite sets or sets with same \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardinality}{cardinality} as $\mathbb{N}$). However, there is no exact definition of term ``discrete mathematics''.

Set of objects studied in discrete mathematics can be finite or infinite. Term {\it finite mathematics} is sometimes applied to parts of field of discrete mathematics that deals with finite sets, particularly those areas relevant to business.

{\sf Graphs e.g. these are among objects studied by discrete mathematics, for their interesting \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_property}{mathematical properties}, their usefulness as models of real-world problems, \& their importance in developing computer algorithms.}

Research in discrete mathematics increased in latter half of 20th century partly due to development of \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_computers}{digital computers} which operate in ``discrete'' steps \& store data in ``discrete'' bits. Concepts \& notations from discrete mathematics are useful in studying \& describing objects \& problems in branches of computer science, e.g. \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_algorithm}{computer algorithms}, \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language}{programming languages}, \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptography}{cryptography}, \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_theorem_proving}{automated theorem proving}, \& \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_development}{software development}. Conversely, computer implementations are significant in applying ideas from discrete mathematics to real-world problems.

Although main objects of study in discrete mathematics are discrete objects, \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_(mathematics)}{analytic} methods from ``continuous'' mathematics are often employed as well.

In university curricula, discrete mathematics are discrete objects, \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_(mathematics)}{analytic} methods from ``continuous'' mathematics are often employed as well.

In university curricula, discrete mathematics appeared in 1980s, initially as a computer science support course; its contents were somewhat haphazard at time. Curriculum has thereafter developed in conjunction with efforts by \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_for_Computing_Machinery}{ACM} \& \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_Association_of_America}{MAA} into a course that is basically intended to develop \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_maturity}{mathematical maturity} in 1st-year students; therefore, it is nowadays a prerequisite for mathematics majors in some universities as well. Some high-school-level discrete mathematics textbooks have appeared as well. At this level, discrete mathematics is sometimes seen as a preparatory course, like \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precalculus}{precalculus} in this respect.

\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fulkerson_Prize}{Fulkerson Prize} is awarded for outstanding papers in discrete mathematics.

\subsubsection{Challenges}
{\sf Much research in \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory}{graph theory} was motivated by attempts to prove: all maps can be \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_coloring}{colored} using \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_color_theorem}{only 4 colors} so that no areas of same color share an edge. \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth_Appel}{\sc Kenneth Appel} \& \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfgang_Haken}{\sc Wolfgang Haken} proved this in 1976.}

History of discrete mathematics has involved a number of challenging problems which have focused attention within areas of field. In graph theory, much research was motivated by attempts to prove \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_color_theorem}{4 color theorem}, 1st stated in 1852, but not proved until 1976 (by {\sc Kenneth Appel \& Wolfgang Haken}, using substantial computer assistance).

In logic, \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert%27s_second_problem}{2nd problem} on \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Hilbert}{\sc David Hilbert}'s list of open \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert%27s_problems}{problems} presented in 1900 was to prove: \fbox{axioms of arithmetic are consistent}. \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del%27s_second_incompleteness_theorem}{G\"odel's 2nd incompleteness theorem}, proved in 1931, showed: this was not possible -- at least not within arithmetic itself. \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert%27s_tenth_problem}{Hilbert's 10th problem} was to determine whether a given polynomial \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diophantine_equation}{Diophantine equation} with integer coefficients has an integer solution. In 1970, \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuri_Matiyasevich}{\sc Yuri Matiyasevich} proved: this \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matiyasevich%27s_theorem}{could not be done}.

Need to \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptanalysis}{break} German codes in \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II}{World War II} led to advances in \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptography}{cryptography} \& \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theoretical_computer_science}{theoretical computer science}, with \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colossus_computer}{1st programmable digital electronic computer} being developed at England's \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bletchley_Park}{Bletchley Park} with guidance of \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing}{\sc Alan Turing} \& his seminal work, {\it On Computable Numbers}. \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_War}{Cold War} meant: cryptography remained important, with fundamental advances e.g. \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography}{public-key cryptography} being developed in following decades. \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telecommunications_industry}{Telecommunication industry} has also motivated advances in discrete mathematics, particularly in graph theory \& \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_theory}{information theory}. \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_verification}{Formal verification} of statements in logic has been necessary for \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_development}{software development} of \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety-critical_system}{safety-critical systems}, \& advances in \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_theorem_proving}{automated theorem proving} have been driven by this need.

\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_geometry}{Computational geometry} has been an important part of \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_graphics_(computer_science)}{computer graphics} incorporated into modern \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game}{video games} \& \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer-aided_design}{computer-aiddd design} tools.

Several fields of discrete mathematics, particularly theoretical computer science, graph theory, \& \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatorics}{combinatorics}, are important in addressing challenging \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioinformatics}{bioinformatics} problems associated with understanding \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phylogenetic_tree}{tree of life}.

Currently, 1 of most famous open problems in theoretical science is \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P_%3D_NP_problem}{P $=$ NP problem}, which involves relationship between \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complexity_class}{complexity classes} \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P_(complexity)}{P} \& \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NP_(complexity)}{NP}. \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay_Mathematics_Institute}{Clay Mathematics Institute} has offered a \$1 million USD prize for 1st correct proof, along with prizes for \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennium_Prize_Problems}{6 other mathematical problems}.'' -- \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_mathematics}{Wikipedia{\tt/}discrete mathematics}
