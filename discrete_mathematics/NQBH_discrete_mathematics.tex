\section{Wikipedia's}

\subsection{Wikipedia{\tt/}discrete mathematics}
``{\it Discrete mathematics} is study of \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_structures}{mathematical structures} that can be considered ``discrete'' (in a way analogous to \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_variable}{discrete variables}, having a \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bijection}{bijection} with $\mathbb{N}$) rather than ``continuous'' (analogously to \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_function}{continuous functions}). Objects studied in discrete mathematics include integers, \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(discrete_mathematics)}{graphs}, \& \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statement_(logic)}{statements} in \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_logic}{logic}. By contrast, discrete mathematics excludes topics in ``continuous mathematics'' e.g. real numbers, calculus or \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_geometry}{Euclidean geometry}. Discrete objects can often be \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enumeration}{enumerated} by integers; more formally, discrete mathematics has been characterized as branch of mathematics dealing with \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Countable_set}{countable sets} (finite sets or sets with same \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardinality}{cardinality} as $\mathbb{N}$). However, there is no exact definition of term ``discrete mathematics''.

Set of objects studied in discrete mathematics can be finite or infinite. Term {\it finite mathematics} is sometimes applied to parts of field of discrete mathematics that deals with finite sets, particularly those areas relevant to business.

{\sf Graphs e.g. these are among objects studied by discrete mathematics, for their interesting \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_property}{mathematical properties}, their usefulness as models of real-world problems, \& their importance in developing computer algorithms.}

Research in discrete mathematics increased in latter half of 20th century partly due to development of \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_computers}{digital computers} which operate in ``discrete'' steps \& store data in ``discrete'' bits. Concepts \& notations from discrete mathematics are useful in studying \& describing objects \& problems in branches of computer science, e.g. \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_algorithm}{computer algorithms}, \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language}{programming languages}, \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptography}{cryptography}, \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_theorem_proving}{automated theorem proving}, \& \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_development}{software development}. Conversely, computer implementations are significant in applying ideas from discrete mathematics to real-world problems.

Although main objects of study in discrete mathematics are discrete objects, \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_(mathematics)}{analytic} methods from ``continuous'' mathematics are often employed as well.

In university curricula, discrete mathematics are discrete objects, \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_(mathematics)}{analytic} methods from ``continuous'' mathematics are often employed as well.

In university curricula, discrete mathematics appeared in 1980s, initially as a computer science support course; its contents were somewhat haphazard at time. Curriculum has thereafter developed in conjunction with efforts by \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_for_Computing_Machinery}{ACM} \& \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_Association_of_America}{MAA} into a course that is basically intended to develop \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_maturity}{mathematical maturity} in 1st-year students; therefore, it is nowadays a prerequisite for mathematics majors in some universities as well. Some high-school-level discrete mathematics textbooks have appeared as well. At this level, discrete mathematics is sometimes seen as a preparatory course, like \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precalculus}{precalculus} in this respect.

\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fulkerson_Prize}{Fulkerson Prize} is awarded for outstanding papers in discrete mathematics.

\subsubsection{Topics}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item {\sf Theoretical computer science.} {\sf\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_complexity_theory}{Complexity} studies time taken by algorithms, e.g. this \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quicksort}{quick sort}.} \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theoretical_computer_science}{Theoretical computer science} includes areas of discrete mathematics relevant to computing. It draws heavily on \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory}{graph theory} \& \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_logic}{mathematical logic}. Included within theoretical computer science is study of algorithms \& data structures. \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computability}{Computability} studies what can be computed in principle, \& has close ties to logic, while complexity studies time, space, \& other resources taken by computations. \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automata_theory}{Automata theory} \& \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_language}{formal language} theory are closely related to computability. \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petri_net}{Petri nets} \& \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process_algebra}{process algebras} are used to model computer systems, \& methods from discrete mathematics are used in analyzing \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VLSI}{VLSI} electronic circuits.
	
	{\sf\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_geometry}{Computational geometry} applies computer algorithms to representations of geometrical objects.} \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_geometry}{Computational geometry} applies algorithms to geometrical problems \& representations of geometrical objects, while \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_image_analysis}{computer image analysis} applies them to representations of images. Theoretical computer science also includes study of various continuous computational topics.
	\item {\sf Information theory.} {\sf\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII}{ASCII} codes for word ``Wikipedia'', given here in \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_numeral_system}{binary}, provide a way of representing word in \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_theory}{information theory}, as well as for information-processing algorithms.} \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_theory}{Information theory} involves quantification of \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information}{information}. Closely related is \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coding_theory}{coding theory} which is used to design efficient \& reliable data transmission \& storage methods. Information theory also includes continuous topics e.g.: \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analog_signal}{analog signals}, \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analog_coding}{analog coding}, \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analog_encryption}{analog encryption}.
	\item {\sf Logic.} \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_logic}{Mathematical logic} is study of principles of valid reasoning \& \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inference}{inference}, as well as of \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistency}{consistency}, \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soundness}{soundness}, \& \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Completeness_(logic)}{completeness}. E.g., in most systems of logic (but not in \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intuitionistic_logic}{intuitionistic logic}) \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peirce%27s_law}{Peirce's law} $(((P\to Q)\to P)\to P)$ is a theorem. For classical logic, it can be easily verified with a \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth_table}{truth table}. Study of \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_proof}{mathematical proof} is particularly important in logic, \& has accumulated to \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_theorem_proving}{automated theorem proving} \& \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_verification}{formal verification} of software.
	
	\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-formed_formula}{Logical formulas} are discrete structures, as are \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_theory}{proofs}, which form finite \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_structure}{trees} or, more generally, \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph}{directed acylic graph} structures (with each \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_inference}{inference step} combining 1 or more \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premise}{premise} branches to give a single conclusion). \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth_value}{Truth values} of logical formulas usually form a finite set, generally restricted to 2 values: true \& false, but logic can also be continuous-valued, e.g., \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuzzy_logic}{fuzzy logic}. Concepts e.g. infinite proof trees or infinite derivation trees have also been studied, e.g., \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinitary_logic}{infinitary logic}.
	\item {\sf Set theory.} \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_theory}{Set theory} is branch of mathematics that studies \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(mathematics)}{sets}, which are collections of objects, e.g. \{blue, white, red\} or (infinite) set of all \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_number}{prime numbers}. \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partially_ordered_set}{Partially ordered sets} \& sets with other \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relation_(mathematics)}{relations} have applications in several areas.
	
	In discrete mathematics, \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Countable_set}{countable sets} (including \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_set}{finite sets}) are main focus. Beginning of set theory as a branch of mathematics is usually marked by \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georg_Cantor}{\sc George Cantor}'s work distinguishing between different kinds of \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite_set}{infinite set}, motivated by study of trigonometric series, \& further development of theory of infinite sets is outside scope of discrete mathematics. Indeed, contemporary work in \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Descriptive_set_theory}{descriptive set theory} makes extensive use of traditional continuous mathematics.
	\item {\sf Combinatorics.} \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatorics}{Combinatorics} studies ways in which discrete structures can be combined or arranged. \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enumerative_combinatorics}{Enumerative combinatorics} concentrates on counting number of certain combinatorial objects -- e.g., \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twelvefold_way}{12fold way} provides a unified framework for counting \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permutations}{permutations}, \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinations}{combinations}, \& \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partition_of_a_set}{partitions}. \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytic_combinatorics}{Analytic combinatorics} concerns enumeration (i.e., determining number) of combinatorial structures using tools from \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_analysis}{complex analysis} \& probability theory. In contrast with enumerative combinatorics which uses explicit combinatorial formulae \& \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generating_functions}{generating functions} to describe results, analytic combinatorics aims at obtaining \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptotic_analysis}{asymptotic formulae}. \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_combinatorics}{Topological combinatorics} concerns use of techniques from \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topology}{topology} \& \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_topology}{algebraic topology}{\tt/}\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatorial_topology}{combinatorial topology} in \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatorics}{combinatorics}. Design theory is a study of \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatorial_design}{combinatorial designs}, which are collections of subsets with certain intersection properties. \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partition_theory}{Partition theory} studies various enumeration \& asymptotic problems related to \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer_partition}{integer partitions}, \& is closely related to \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q-series}{q-series}, \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_functions}{special functions}, \& \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthogonal_polynomials}{orthogonal polynomials}. Originally a part of number theory \& analysis, partition theory is now considered a part of combinatorics or an independent field. \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_theory}{Order theory} is study of \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partially_ordered_sets}{partially ordered sets}, both finite \& infinite.
	\item {\sf Graph theory.} {\sf\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory}{Graph theory} has close links to \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_theory}{group theory}. This \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truncated_tetrahedron}{truncated tetrahedron} graph is related to \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternating_group}{alternating group} $A_4$.} \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory}{Graph theory}, study of \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(discrete_mathematics)}{graphs} \& \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_theory}{networks}, is often considered part of combinatorics, but has grown large enough \& distinct enough, with its own kind of problems, to be regarded as a subject in its own right. Graphs are 1 of prime objects of study in discrete mathematics. They are among most ubiquitous models of both natural \& human-made structures. They can model many types of relations \& process dynamics in physical, biological \& social systems. In computer science, they can represent networks of communication, data organization, computational devices, flow of computation, etc. In mathematics, they are useful in geometry \& certain parts of topology, e.g. \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knot_theory}{knot theory}. \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_graph_theory}{Algebraic graph theory} has close links with group theory \& \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_graph_theory}{topological graph theory} has close links to topology. There are also \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_graph}{continuous graphs}; however, for most part, research in graph theory falls within domain of discrete mathematics.
	\item {\sf Number theory.} {\sf\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulam_spiral}{Ulam spiral} of numbers, with black pixels showing prime numbers. This diagram hints at patterns in \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_number#Distribution}{distribution} of prime numbers.} \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_theory}{Number theory} is concerned with properties of numbers in general, particularly integers. It has applications to \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptography}{cryptography} \& \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptanalysis}{cryptanalysis}, particularly with regard to \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_arithmetic}{modular arithmetic}, \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diophantine_equations}{diophantine equations}, linear \& quadratic congruences, prime numbers \& \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primality_test}{primality testing}. Other discrete aspects of number theory include \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometry_of_numbers}{geometry of numbers}. In \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytic_number_theory}{analytic number theory}, techniques from continuous mathematics are also used. Topics that go beyond discrete objects include \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcendental_number}{transcendental numbers}, \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diophantine_approximation}{diophantine approximation}, \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P-adic_analysis}{p-adic analysis} \& \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_field_of_an_algebraic_variety}{function fields}.
	\item {\sf Algebraic structures.} Main article: \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_algebra}{Wikipedia{\tt/}abstract algebra}. \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_structure}{Algebraic structures} occur as both discrete examples \& continuous examples. Discrete algebras include: \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_algebra_(logic)}{Boolean algebra} used in \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_gate}{logic gates} \& programming; \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_algebra}{relational algebra} used in \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Databases}{databases}; discrete \& finite versions of groups, rings, \& fields are important in \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_coding_theory}{algebraic coding theory}; discrete \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semigroup}{semigroups} \& \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoid}{monoids} appear in theory of \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_languages}{formal languages}.
	\item {\sf Discrete analogues of continuous mathematics.} There are many concepts \& theories in continuous mathematics which have discrete versions, e.g. \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_calculus}{discrete calculus}, \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_Fourier_transform}{discrete Fourier transforms}, \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_geometry}{discrete geometry}, \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_logarithm}{discrete logarithms}, \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_differential_geometry}{discrete differential geometry}, \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_exterior_calculus}{discrete exterior calculus}, \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_Morse_theory}{discrete Morse theory}, \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_optimization}{discrete optimization}, \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_probability_theory}{discrete probability theory}, \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_probability_distribution}{discrete probability distribution}, \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Difference_equation}{difference equations}, \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_dynamical_system}{discrete dynamical systems}, \& \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shapley%E2%80%93Folkman_lemma#Probability_and_measure_theory}{discrete vector measures}.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item {\sf Calculus of finite differences, discrete analysis.} In \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_calculus}{discrete calculus} \& \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus_of_finite_differences}{calculus of finite differences}, a function defined on an interval of integers is usually called a \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence}{sequence}. A sequence could be a finite sequence from a data source or an infinite sequence from a \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_dynamical_system}{discrete dynamical system}. Such a discrete function could be defined explicitly by a list (if its domain is finite), or by a formula for its general term, or it could be given implicitly by a \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recurrence_relation}{recurrence relation} or \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Difference_equation}{difference equation}. Difference equations are similar to \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_equation}{differential equations}, but replace \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derivative}{differentiation} by taking difference between adjacent terms; they can be used to approximate differential equations or (more often) studied in their own right. Many questions \& methods concerning differential equations have counterparts for difference equations. E.g., where there are \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral_transforms}{integral transforms} in \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonic_analysis}{harmonic analysis} for studying continuous functions for analogue signals, there are \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_transform}{discrete transforms} for discrete functions or digital signals. As well as \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_metric_space}{discrete metric spaces}, there are more general \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_topological_space}{discrete topological spaces}, \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_metric_space}{finite metric spaces}, \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_topological_space}{finite topological spaces}.
		
		\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_scale_calculus}{Time scale calculus} is a unification of theory of \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Difference_equations}{difference equations} with that of \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_equations}{differential equations}, which has applications to fields requiring simultaneous modeling of discrete \& continuous data. Another way of modeling such a situation is notion of \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_system}{hybrid dynamical systems}.
		\item {\sf Discrete geometry.} \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_geometry}{Discrete geometry} \& combinatorial geometry are about combinatorial properties of {\it discrete collections} of geometrical objects. A long-standing topic in discrete geometry is \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tessellation}{tiling of plane}.
		
		In \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_geometry}{algebraic geometry}, concept of a curve can be extended to discrete geometries by taking \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrum_of_a_ring}{spectra} of \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial_ring}{polynomials rings} over \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_field}{finite fields} to be models of \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_space}{affine spaces} over that field, \& letting \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_variety}{subvarieties} or spectra of other rings provide curves that lie in that space. Although space in which curves appear has a finite number of points, curves are not so much sets of points as analogues of curves in continuous settings. E.g., every point of form $V(x - c)\subset{\rm Spec}K[x] = \mathbb{A}^1$ for $K$ a field can be studied either as ${\rm Spec}K[x]/(x - c)\cong{\rm Spec}K$, a point, or as spectrum ${\rm Spec}K[x]_{(x - c)}$ of \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Localization_of_a_ring}{local ring at $(x - c)$}, a point together with a neighborhood around it. Algebraic varieties also have a well-defined notion of \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangent_space}{tangent space} called \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zariski_tangent_space}{Zariski tangent space}, making many features of calculus applicable even in finite settings.
		\item {\sf Discrete modeling.} In \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applied_mathematics}{applied mathematics}, \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_modelling}{discrete modeling} is discrete analogue of \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_modelling}{continuous modeling}. In discrete modeling, discrete formulae are fit to \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data}{data}. A common method in this form of modeling is to use \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recurrence_relation}{recurrence relation}. \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discretization}{Discretization} concerns process of transferring continuous models \& equations into discrete counterparts, often for purposes of making calculations easier by using approximations. \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_analysis}{Numerical analysis} provides an important example.

\subsubsection{Challenges}
{\sf Much research in \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory}{graph theory} was motivated by attempts to prove: all maps can be \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_coloring}{colored} using \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_color_theorem}{only 4 colors} so that no areas of same color share an edge. \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth_Appel}{\sc Kenneth Appel} \& \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfgang_Haken}{\sc Wolfgang Haken} proved this in 1976.}

History of discrete mathematics has involved a number of challenging problems which have focused attention within areas of field. In graph theory, much research was motivated by attempts to prove \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_color_theorem}{4 color theorem}, 1st stated in 1852, but not proved until 1976 (by {\sc Kenneth Appel \& Wolfgang Haken}, using substantial computer assistance).

In logic, \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert%27s_second_problem}{2nd problem} on \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Hilbert}{\sc David Hilbert}'s list of open \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert%27s_problems}{problems} presented in 1900 was to prove: axioms of arithmetic are consistent. \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del%27s_second_incompleteness_theorem}{G\"odel's 2nd incompleteness theorem}, proved in 1931, showed: this was not possible -- at least not within arithmetic itself. \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert%27s_tenth_problem}{Hilbert's 10th problem} was to determine whether a given polynomial \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diophantine_equation}{Diophantine equation} with integer coefficients has an integer solution. In 1970, \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuri_Matiyasevich}{\sc Yuri Matiyasevich} proved: this \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matiyasevich%27s_theorem}{could not be done}.

Need to \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptanalysis}{break} German codes in \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II}{World War II} led to advances in \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptography}{cryptography} \& \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theoretical_computer_science}{theoretical computer science}, with \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colossus_computer}{1st programmable digital electronic computer} being developed at England's \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bletchley_Park}{Bletchley Park} with guidance of \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing}{\sc Alan Turing} \& his seminal work, {\it On Computable Numbers}. \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_War}{Cold War} meant: cryptography remained important, with fundamental advances e.g. \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography}{public-key cryptography} being developed in following decades. \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telecommunications_industry}{Telecommunication industry} has also motivated advances in discrete mathematics, particularly in graph theory \& \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_theory}{information theory}. \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_verification}{Formal verification} of statements in logic has been necessary for \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_development}{software development} of \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety-critical_system}{safety-critical systems}, \& advances in \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_theorem_proving}{automated theorem proving} have been driven by this need.

\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_geometry}{Computational geometry} has been an important part of \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_graphics_(computer_science)}{computer graphics} incorporated into modern \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game}{video games} \& \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer-aided_design}{computer-aiddd design} tools.

Several fields of discrete mathematics, particularly theoretical computer science, graph theory, \& \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatorics}{combinatorics}, are important in addressing challenging \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioinformatics}{bioinformatics} problems associated with understanding \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phylogenetic_tree}{tree of life}.

Currently, 1 of most famous open problems in theoretical science is \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P_%3D_NP_problem}{P $=$ NP problem}, which involves relationship between \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complexity_class}{complexity classes} \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P_(complexity)}{P} \& \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NP_(complexity)}{NP}. \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay_Mathematics_Institute}{Clay Mathematics Institute} has offered a \$1 million USD prize for 1st correct proof, along with prizes for \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennium_Prize_Problems}{6 other mathematical problems}.'' -- \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_mathematics}{Wikipedia{\tt/}discrete mathematics}

\subsection{Wikipedia{\tt/}outline of discrete mathematics}
``\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_mathematics}{Discrete} is study of \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_structure}{mathematical structures} that are fundamentally \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_space}{discrete} rather than \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_function}{continuous}. In contrast to real numbers that have property of varying ``smoothly'', objects studied in discrete mathematics -- e.g. integers, graphs, \& statements in logic -- do not vary smoothly in this way, but have distinct, separated values. Discrete mathematics, therefore, excludes topics in ``continuous mathematics'' e.g. calculus \& analysis.

Included below are many of standard term used routinely in university-level courses \& in research papers. This is not, however, intended as a complete list of mathematical terms; just a selection of typical \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Term_of_art}{terms of art} that may be encountered.
\begin{itemize}
	\item \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic}{Logic}: Study of correct reasoning.
