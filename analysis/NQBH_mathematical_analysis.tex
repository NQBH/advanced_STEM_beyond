Tôi được giải Nhì Giải tích Olympic Toán Sinh viên 2014 (VMC2014) khi còn học năm nhất Đại học \& được giải Nhất Giải tích Olympic Toán Sinh viên 2015 (VMC2015) khi học năm 2 Đại học. Nhưng điều đó không có nghĩa là tôi giỏi Giải tích. Bằng chứng là 10 năm sau khi nhận các giải đó, tôi đang tự học lại Giải tích Toán học với hy vọng có 1 hay nhiều cách nhìn mới mẻ hơn \& mang tính ứng dụng hơn cho các đề tài cá nhân của tôi.

``Analysis is the art of taking limits, \& the constraint of having to deal with an integration theory that does not allow taking limits is much like having to do mathematics only with rational numbers \& excluding the irrational ones.'' -- \cite[Chap. 1, p. 1]{Lieb_Loss2001}

\subsection{Wikipedia{\tt/}A Mathematician's Apology}
``{\it A Mathematician's Apology} \cite{Hardy1940,Hardy1992,Hardy2022} is a 1940 essay by British mathematician \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G._H._Hardy}{\sc G. H. Hardy} which defends the pursuit of mathematics for its own sake. Central to {\sc Hardy}'s ``\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apologetics}{apology}'' -- in the sense of a formal justification or defence (as in {\sc Plato}'s \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apology_(Plato)}{\it Apology of Socrates}) -- is an argument that mathematics has value independent of its applications. {\sc Hardy} located this value in what he called the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_beauty}{beauty of mathematics} \& gave some examples of \& criteria for mathematical beauty. The book also includes a brief autobiography which gives insight into the mind of a working mathematician.

\subsubsection{Background}
{\sc Hardy} wished to justify his life's work in mathematics for 2 reasons. 1stly, having survived a heart attack \& being at the age of 62, {\sc Hardy} knew that he was approaching old age \& that his mathematical creativity \& skills were declining. By devoting time to writing the Apology, {\sc Hardy} was admitting that his own time as a creative mathematician was finished. In his foreword to the 1967 edition of the book, \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C._P._Snow}{\sc C. P. Snow} describes the Apology as ``a passionate lament for creative powers that used to be \& that will never come again''. In {\sc Hardy}'s words, ``Exposition, criticism, appreciation, is work for 2nd-rate mind. [$\ldots$] It is a melancholy experience for a professional mathematician to find himself writing about mathematics. The function of a mathematician is to do something, to prove new theorems, to add to mathematics, \& not to talk about what he or other mathematicians have done.''

2ndly, at the start of \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II}{World War II}, {\sc Hardy}, a committed \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacifist}{pacifist}, wanted to justify his belief that mathematics should be pursued for its own sake rather than for the sake of its applications. He began writing on this subject when he was invited to contribute an article to {\it Eureka}, the journal of \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Archimedeans}{The Archimedeans} (the Cambridge University student mathematical society). 1 of the topics the editor suggested was ``something about mathematics \& the war'', \& the result was the article ``Mathematics in war-time''. {\sc Hardy} later incorporated his article into {\it A Mathematician's Apology}.

{\sc Hardy} wanted to write a book in which he would explain his mathematical philosophy to the next generation of mathematicians. He hoped that in this book he could inspire future generations about the importance of mathematics without appealing to its applied uses.

{\sc Hardy} initially submitted {\it A Mathematician's Apology} to \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambridge_University_Press}{Cambridge University Press} with the intention of personally paying for its printing, but the Press decided to fund publication with an initial run of 4000 copies. For the 1940 1st edition, {\sc Hardy} sent postcards to the publisher requesting that presentation copies be sent to his sister {\sc Gertrude Emily Hardy} (1878--1963), \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C._D._Broad}{\sc C. D. Broad}, \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Edensor_Littlewood}{\sc John Edensor Littlewood}, Sir \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Eddington}{\sc Arthur Eddington}, \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C._P._Snow}{C. P. Snow}, the cricketer \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Lomas_(cricketer)}{\sc John Lomas} (to whom {\sc G. H. Hardy} dedicated the book), and others.

\subsubsection{Summary}
1 of the main themes of the book is the beauty that mathematics possesses, which {\sc Hardy} compares to painting \& poetry. For {\sc Hardy}, the most beautiful mathematics was that which had no practical applications (pure mathematics) \&, in particular \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_theory}{number theory}, {\sc Hardy}'s own field. {\sc Hardy} contends that if useful knowledge is defined as knowledge which is likely to contribute to material comfort without respect to mere intellectual satisfaction, then most of higher mathematics is useless. He justifies the pursuit of pure mathematics with the argument that its very ``uselessness'' means that it cannot be misused to cause harm. On the other hand, {\sc Hardy} denigrates much of the applied mathematics as either being ``trivial'', ``ugly'', or ``dull'' \& contrasts it with ``real mathematics'', which is how he describes pure mathematics.

{\sc Hardy} comments about a phrase attributed to \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Friedrich_Gauss}{\sc Carl Friedrich Gauss}: ``Mathematics is the queen of the sciences \& number theory is the queen of mathematics.'' One may believe that it is the relative sparseness of number theory in applied mathematics that led {\sc Gauss} to the above statement; however, {\sc Hardy} points out that this is certainly not the case. If an application of number theory were to be found, then certainly no one would try to dethrone the ``queen of mathematics'' by it. What {\sc Gauss} meant, according to {\sc Hardy}, is that the underlying concepts that constitute number theory are deeper \& more elegant compared to those of any other branch of mathematics.

Another theme is that mathematics is a ``young man's game''. {\sc Hardy} believed that anyone with a talent for mathematics should develop \& use that talent while they are young, before their ability to create original mathematics starts to decline in middle age. This view reflects {\sc Hardy}'s increasing depression at the waning of his own mathematical skill. For {\sc Hardy}, real mathematics was essentially a creative activity, rather than an explanatory or expository one.

\subsubsection{Critiques}
{\sc Hardy}'s opinions were heavily influenced by the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academia}{academia} culture of the universities \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambridge}{Cambridge} \& \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxford}{Oxford} between \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I}{World War I} \& \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II}{World War II}.

Some of {\sc Hardy}'s examples seem unfortunate in retrospect. E.g., he writes, ``No one has yet discovered many warlike purpose to be served by the theory of numbers or relativity, \& it seems unlikely that anyone will do so for many years.'' Since then number theory was used to crack German \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enigma_machine}{Enigma codes}, \& much later figured prominently in \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography}{public-key cryptography}; furthermore, the inter-convertability of mass \& energy predicted by \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_relativity}{special relativity} forms the physical basis for nuclear weapons.

Applicability itself is not the reason that {\sc Hardy} considered applied mathematics inferior to pure mathematics; it is the simplicity \& vulgarity that belong to applied mathematics that led him to describe it as he did. He considered that \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolle%27s_theorem}{Rolle's theorem}, e.g., cannot be compared to the elegance \& preeminence of the mathematics produced by \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89variste_Galois}{\sc\'Evasriste Galois} \& other pure mathematicians, although it is of some importance for \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus}{calculus}.'' -- \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Mathematician%27s_Apology}{Wikipedia{\tt/}A Mathematician's Apology}

\subsection{Wikipedia{\tt/}functional analysis}
``{\sf 1 of the possible modes of vibration of an idealized circular \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drum_head}{drum head}. These modes are \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eigenfunction}{eigenfunctions} of a linear operator on a function space, a common construction in functional analysis.} {\sf Functional analysis} is a branch of \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_analysis}{mathematical analysis}, the core of which is formed by the study of \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space}{vector spaces} endowed with some kind of limit-related structure (e.g., \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inner_product_space#Definition}{inner product}, \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norm_(mathematics)#Definition}{norm}, or \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_space#Definition}{topology}) \& the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_transformation}{linear funcitons} defined on these spaces \& suitably respecting these structures. The historical roots of functional analysis lie in the study of \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_space}{spaces of functions} \& the formulation of properties of transformations of functions e.g. \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_transform}{Fourier transform} as transformations defining, e.g., continuous or \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unitary_operator}{unitary} operators between function spaces. This point of view turned out to be particularly useful for the study of \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_equations}{differential equation} \& \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral_equations}{integral equation}.

The usage of the word \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_(mathematics)}{\it functional} as a noun goes back to the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus_of_variations}{calculus of variations}, implying a \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher-order_function}{function whose argument is a function}. The term was 1st used in \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques_Hadamard}{\sc Hadamard}'s 1910 book on that subject. However, the general concept of a functional had previously been introduced in 1887 by the Italian mathematician \& physicist \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vito_Volterra}{\sc Vito Volterra}. The theory of nonlinear functionals was continued by students of {\sc Hadamard}, in particular \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ren%C3%A9_Maurice_Fr%C3%A9chet}{\sc Fr\'echet} \& \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_L%C3%A9vy_(mathematician)}{\sc L\'evy}. {\sc Hadamard} also found the modern school of linear functional analysis further developed by \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frigyes_Riesz}{\sc Riesz} \& the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lw%C3%B3w_School_of_Mathematics}{group} of Polish mathematicians around \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stefan_Banach}{\sc Stefan Banach}.

In modern introductory texts on functional analysis, the subject is seen as the study of vector spaces endowed with a topology, in particular \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimension_(vector_space)}{infinite-dimensional spaces}. In contrast, \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_algebra}{linear algebra} deals mostly with finite-dimensional spaces, \& does not use topology. An important part of functional analysis is the extension of the theories of \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measure_(mathematics)}{measure}, \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral}{integration}, \& \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability}{probability} to infinite-dimensional spaces, also known as {\it infinite dimensional analysis}.

\subsubsection{Normed vector spaces}
The basic \& historically 1st class of spaces studied in functional analysis are \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complete_space}{complete} \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normed_vector_space}{normed vector spaces} over the $\mathbb{R}$ or $\mathbb{C}$, called \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banach_space}{Banach spaces}. An important example is a \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert_space}{Hilbert space}, where the norm arises from an inner product. These spaces are of fundamental importance in many areas, including the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_formulation_of_quantum_mechanics}{mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics}, machine learning ML, PDEs, \& \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_analysis}{Fourier analysis}.

More generally, functional analysis includes the study of \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fr%C3%A9chet_space}{Fr\'echet spaces} \& other \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_vector_space}{topological vector spaes} not endowed with a norm.

An important object of study in functional analysis are the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_function_(topology)}{continuous} \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_transformation}{linear operators} defined on Banach \& Hilbert spaces. These lead naturally to the definition of \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C*-algebra}{$C^\star$-algebras} \& other \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operator_algebra}{operator algebras}.
\begin{itemize}
	\item {\sf Hilbert spaces.} \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert_space}{Hilbert spaces} can be completely classified: there is a unique Hilbert space \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Up_to}{upto} \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isomorphism}{isomorphism} for every \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardinal_number}{cardinality} of the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthonormal_basis}{orthonormal basis}. Finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces are fully understood in \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_algebra}{linear algebra}, \& infinite-dimensional \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separable_space}{separable} Hilbert spaces are isomorphic to $l^2(\aleph_0)$. Separability being important for applications, functional analysis of Hilbert spaces consequently mostly deals with this space. 1 of the open problems in functional analysis is to prove that every bounded linear operator on a Hilbert space has a proper \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invariant_subspace}{invariant subspace}. Many special cases of this \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invariant_subspace_problem}{invariant subspace problem} have already been proven.
	\item {\sf Banach spaces.} General \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banach_space}{Banach spaces} are more complicated than Hilbert spaces, \& cannot be classified in such a simple manner as those. In particular, many Banach spaces lack a notion analogous to an \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthonormal_basis}{orthonormal basis}. Examples of Banach spaces are \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lp_space}{$L^p$-spaces} for $p\in[1,\infty)$. Given also a measure $\mu$ on set $X$, then $L^p(X)$, sometimes also denoted $L^p(X,\mu)$ or $L^p(\mu)$, has as its vectors equivalence classes $[f]$ of \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebesgue-measurable_function}{measurable functions} whose \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_value}{absolute value}'s $p$th power has finite integral, i.e., functions $f$ for which one has $\int_X |f(x)|^p\,{\rm d}\mu(x) < \infty$. If $\mu$ is the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counting_measure}{counting measure}, then the integral may be replaced by a sum, i.e., require $\sum_{x\in X} |f(x)|^p < \infty$. Then it is not necessary to deal with equivalence classes, \& the space is denoted $l^p(X)$, written more simply $l^p$ in the case when $X = \mathbb{N}$.
	
	In Banach spaces, a large part of the study involves the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_dual}{dual space}: the space of all continuous linear maps from the space into its underlying field, so-called functionals. A Banach space can be canonically identified with a subspace of its bidual, which is the dual of its dual space. The corresponding map is an \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isometry}{isometry} but in general not onto. A general Banach space \& its bidual need not even be isometrically isomorphic in any way, contrary to the finite-dimensional situation. This s explained in the dual space article. Also, the notion of \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derivative}{derivative} can be extended to arbitrary functions between Banach spaces, see, e.g., \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fr%C3%A9chet_derivative}{Wikipedia{\tt/}Fr\'echet derivative}.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Linear functional analysis}

\subsubsection{Major \& foundational results}
There are 4 major theorems which are sometimes called the 4 pillars of functional analysis:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hahn%E2%80%93Banach_theorem}{Hahn--Banach theorem}
	\item \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_mapping_theorem_(functional_analysis)}{opening mapping theorem}
	\item \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed_graph_theorem_(functional_analysis)}{closed graph theorem}
	\item \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_boundedness_principle}{uniform boundedness principle}, also known as the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banach%E2%80%93Steinhaus_theorem}{Banach--Steinhaus theorem}.
\end{enumerate}
Important results of functional analysis include:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item {\bf Uniform bounded principle.} Main article: \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banach-Steinhaus_theorem}{Wikipedia{\tt/}Banach--Steinhause theorem}. The \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_boundedness_principle}{uniform boundedness principle} or \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banach%E2%80%93Steinhaus_theorem}{Banach--Steinhaus theorem} is 1 of the fundamental results in functional analysis. Together with the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hahn%E2%80%93Banach_theorem}{Hahn--Banach theorem} \& the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_mapping_theorem_(functional_analysis)}{opening mapping theorem}, it is considered 1 of the cornerstones of the field. In its basic form, it asserts that for a family of \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_linear_operator}{continuous linear operators} (\& thus bounded operators) whose domain is a \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banach_space}{Banach space}, pointwise boundedness is equivalent to uniform boundedness in operator form. The theorem was 1st published in 1927 by \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stefan_Banach}{\sc Stefan Banach} \& \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugo_Steinhaus}{\sc Hugo Steinhaus} but it was also proven independently by \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Hahn_(mathematician)}{\sc Hans Hahn}.
	
	\begin{theorem}[Uniform Boundedness Principle]
		Let $X$ be a Banach space \& $Y$ be a \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normed_vector_space}{normed vector space}. Suppose that $F$ is a collection of continuous linear operators from $X\to Y$. If $\forall x\in X$, one has $\sup_{T\in F} \|T(x)\|_Y < \infty$, then $\sup_{T\in F} \|T\|_{B(X,Y)} < \infty$.
	\end{theorem}	
	\item {\bf Spectral theorem.} Main article: \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectral_theorem}{Wikipedia{\tt/}spectral theorem}. There are many theorems known as the spectral theorem, but one in particular has many applications in functional analysis.
	
	\begin{theorem}[Spectral theorem]
		Let $A$ be a bounded self-adjoint operator on a Hilbert space $H$. Then there is a \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measure_space}{measure space} $(X,\Sigma,\mu)$ \& a real-valued \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ess_sup}{essentially bounded} measurable function $f$ on $X$ \& a unitary operator $U:H\to L_\mu^2(X)$ s.t. $U^\star TU = A$ where $T$ is the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplication_operator}{multiplication operator}: $[T\varphi](x) = f(x)\varphi(x)$, \& $\|T\| = \|f\|_\infty$.
	\end{theorem}
	This is the beginning of the vast research area of functional analysis called \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operator_theory}{operator theory}, see also \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectral_measure#Spectral_measure}{spectral measure}. There is also an analogous spectral theorem for bounded \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_operator}{normal operators} on Hilbert spaces. The only difference in the conclusion is that now $f$ may be complex-valued.
	\item {\bf Hahn--Banach theorem.} Main article: \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hahn%E2%80%93Banach_theorem}{Wikipedia{\tt/}Hahn--Banach theorem}. The Hahn--Banach theorem is a central tool in functional analysis. It allows the extension of \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bounded_operator}{bounded linear functionals} defined on a subspace of some vector space to the whole space, \& it also shows that there are ``enough'' continuous linear functionals defined on every \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normed_vector_space}{normed vector space} to make the study of the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_space}{dual space} ``interesting''.
	
	\begin{theorem}[Hahn--Banach theorem]
		If $p:V\to\mathbb{R}$ is a \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sublinear_function}{sublinear function}, \& $\varphi:U\to\mathbb{R}$ is a \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_functional}{linear functional} on a \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_subspace}{linear subspace} $U\subseteq V$ which is dominated by $p$ on $U$, i.e., $\varphi(x)\le p(x)$, $\forall x\in U$, then there exists a linear extension $\psi:V\to\mathbb{R}$ of $\varphi$ to the whole space $V$ which is dominated by $p$ on $V$, i.e., there exists a linear functional $\psi$ s.t. $\psi(x) = \varphi(x)$, $\forall x\in U$, $\psi(x)\le p(x)$, $\forall x\in V$.
	\end{theorem}
	\item {\bf Open mapping theorem.} Main article: \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_mapping_theorem_(functional_analysis)}{Wikipedia{\tt/}open mapping theorem (functional analysis)}. The open mapping theorem, also known as the Banach--Schauder theorem (named after \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stefan_Banach}{\sc Stefan Banach} \& \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juliusz_Schauder}{\sc Juliusz Schauder}), is a fundamental result which states that if a \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bounded_linear_operator}{continuous linear operator} between Banach spaces is surjective then it is an \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_map}{open map}. More precisely,
	
	\begin{theorem}[Open mapping theorem]
		If $X,Y$ are Banach spaces \& $A:X\to Y$ i a surjective continuous linear operator, then $A$ is an open map (i.e., if $U$ is an open set in $X$, then $A(U)$ is open in $Y$).
	\end{theorem}
	The proof uses the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baire_category_theorem}{Baire category theorem}, \& completeness of both $X,Y$ is essential to the theorem. The statement of the theorem is no longer true if either space is just assumed to be a \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normed_space}{normed space}, but is true if $X,Y$ are taken to be \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fr%C3%A9chet_space}{Fr\'echet spaces}.
	\item {\bf Closed graph theorem.} Main article: \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed_graph_theorem}{Wikipedia{\tt/}closed graph theorem}
	
	\begin{theorem}[Closed graph theorem]
		If $X$ is a \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_space}{topological space} \& $Y$ is a \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_space}{compact} \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hausdorff_space}{Hausdorff space}, then the graph of a linear map $T:X\to Y$ is closed iff $T$ is continuous.
	\end{theorem}
	\item Other topics, see \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_functional_analysis_topics}{Wikipedia{\tt/}list of functional analysis topics}.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Foundations of mathematics considerations}
Most spaces considered in functional analysis have infinite dimension. To show the existence of a \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space_basis}{vector space basis} for such spaces may require \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zorn%27s_lemma}{Zorn's lemma}. However, a somewhat different concept, the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schauder_basis}{Schauder basis}, is usually more relevant in functional analysis. Many theorems require the Hahn--Banach theorem, usually proved using the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom_of_choice}{axiom of choice}, although the strictly weaker \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_prime_ideal_theorem}{Boolean prime ideal theorem} suffices. The \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baire_category_theorem}{Baire category theorem}, needed to prove many important theorems, also requires a form of axiom of choice.

\subsubsection{Point of view}
Functional analysis includes the following tendencies:
\begin{itemize}

\subsection{Wikipedia{\tt/}Helmholtz decomposition}
``In physics \& mathematics, the {\it Helmholtz decomposition theorem} or the {\it fundamental theorem of vector calculus} states that certain differentiable \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_field}{vector fields} can be resolved into the sum of an \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irrotational_vector_field}{irrotational} (\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curl_(mathematics)}{curl}-free) vector field \& a \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solenoidal}{solenoidal} (\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divergence}{divergence}-free) vector field. In physics, often only the decomposition of sufficiently smooth, rapidly decaying vector fields in 3D is discussed. It is named after \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermann_von_Helmholtz}{\sc Hermann von Helmholtz}.

\begin{definition}
	For a vector field ${\bf F}\in C^1(V,\mathbb{R}^n)$ defined on a domain $V\subseteq\mathbb{R}^n$, a \emph{Helmholtz decomposition} is a pair of vector fields ${\bf G}\in C^1(V,\mathbb{R}^n),{\bf R}\in C^1(V,\mathbb{R}^n)$ s.t. ${\bf F}({\bf r}) = {\bf G}({\bf r}) + {\bf R}({\bf r})$, ${\bf G}({\bf r}) = -\nabla\Phi({\bf r})$, $\nabla\cdot{\bf R}({\bf r}) = 0$. Here, $\Phi\in C^2(V,\mathbb{R})$ is a \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalar_potential}{scalar potential}, $\nabla\Phi$ is its gradient, \& $\nabla\cdot{\bf R}$ is the divergence of the vector field ${\bf R}$. The irrotational vector field ${\bf G}$ is called a \emph{gradient field} \& $\mathbb{R}$ is called a \emph{solenoidal field} or \emph{rotation field}. This decomposition does not exist for all vector fields \& is not unique.
\end{definition}

\subsubsection{History}
The Helmholtz decomposition in 3D was 1st described in 1849 by \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Gabriel_Stokes}{\sc George Gabriel Stokes} for a theory of \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffraction}{diffraction}. \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermann_von_Helmholtz}{\sc Hermann von Helmholtz} published his paper on some \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrodynamics}{hydrodynamic} basic equations in 1858, which was part of his research on the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helmholtz%27s_theorems}{Helmholtz's theorems} describing the motion of fluid in the vicinity of vortex lines. Their derivation required the vector fields to decay sufficiently fast at $\infty$. Later, this condition could be relaxed, \& the Helmholtz decomposition could be extended to higher dimensions. For \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemannian_manifold}{Riemannian manifolds}, the Helmholtz-Hodge decomposition using \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_geometry}{differential geometry} \& \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor_calculus}{tensor calculus} was derived.

The decomposition has become an important tool for many problems in \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theoretical_physics}{theoretical physics}, but has also found applications in \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animation}{animation}, \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_vision}{computer vision} as well as \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robotics}{robotics}

\subsubsection{3D space}
Many physics textbooks restrict the Helmholtz decomposition to 3D space \& limit its application to vector fields that decay sufficiently fast at $\infty$ or to \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bump_function}{bump functions} that are defined on a \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bounded_domain}{bounded domain}. Then, a \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_potential}{vector potential} $A$ can be defined, s.t. the rotation field is given by ${\bf R} = \nabla\times{\bf A}$, using the curl of a vector field.

Let ${\bf F}$ be a vector field on a bounded domain $V\subseteq\mathbb{R}^3$, which is twice continuously differentiable inside $V$, \& let $S$ be the surface that encloses the domain $V$. Then ${\bf F}$ can be decomposed into a curl-free component \& a divergence-free component as \fbox{${\bf F} = -\nabla\Phi + \nabla\times{\bf A}$}. [$\ldots$]

\subsubsection{Generalization to higher dimensions}

\subsubsection{Differential forms}
The \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hodge_decomposition#Hodge_decomposition}{Hodge decomposition} is closely related to the Helmholtz decomposition, generalizing from vector fields on $\mathbb{R}^3$ to \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_forms}{differential forms} on a \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemannian_manifold}{Riemannian manifold} $M$. Most formulations of the Hodge decomposition require $M$ to be \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_space}{compact}. Since this is not true of $\mathbb{R}^3$, the Hodge decomposition theorem is not strictly a generalization of the Helmholtz theorem. However, the compactness restriction in the usual formulation of the Hodge decomposition can be replaced by suitable decay assumptions at infinity on the differential forms involved, giving a proper generalization of the Helmholtz theorem.

\subsubsection{Extensions to fields not decaying at infinity}

\subsubsection{Uniqueness of the solution}

\subsubsection{Applications}

\begin{itemize}
	\item {\bf Electrodynamics.} The Helmholtz theorem is of particular interest in \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrodynamics}{electrodynamics}, since it can be used to write \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell%27s_equations}{Maxwell's equations} in the potential image \& solve them more easily. The Helmholtz decomposition can be used to prove that, given \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_current_density}{electric current density} \& \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charge_density}{charge density}, the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_field}{electric field} \& the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_flux_density}{magnetic flux density} can be determined. They are unique if the densities vanish at infinity \& one assumes the same for the potentials.
	\item {\bf Fluid dynamics.} In \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid_dynamics}{fluid dynamics}, the Helmholtz projection plays an important role, especially for the solvability theory of NSEs. If the Helmholtz projection is applied to the linearized incompressible NSEs, the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stokes_flow}{Stokes equation} is obtained. This depends only on the velocity of the particles in the flow, but no longer on the static pressure, allowing the equation to be reduced to 1 unknown. However, both equations, the Stokes \& linearization equations, are equivalent. The operator $P\Delta$ is called the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stokes_operator}{Stokes operator}.
	\item {\bf Dynamical systems theory.} In the theory of \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamical_system}{dynamical systems}, Helmholtz decomposition can be used to determine ``quasipotentials'' as well as to compute \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyapunov_function}{Lyapunov functions} in some cases. 
	\item {\bf Medical Imaging.} In \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_elastography}{magnetic resonance elastography}, a variant of MR imaging where mechanical waves are used to probe the viscoelasticity of organs, the Helmholtz decomposition is sometimes used to separate the measured displacement fields into its shear component (divergence-free) \& its compression component (curl-free). In this way, the complex shear modulus can be calculated without contributions from compression waves.
	\item {\bf Computer animation \& robotics.} The Helmholtz decomposition is also used in the field of computer engineering. This includes robotics, image reconstruction but also computer animation, where the decomposition is used for realistic visualization of fluids or vector fields.'' -- \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helmholtz_decomposition}{Wikipedia{\tt/}Helmholtz decomposition}

\subsection{Wikipedia{\tt/}integral transform}
\textbf{\textsf{Resources -- Tài nguyên.}}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item {\sc Đặng Đình Áng}. {\it Biến Đổi Tích Phân}.
\end{enumerate}
``In mathematics, an {\it integral transform} is a type of \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transform_(mathematics)}{transform} that maps a \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)}{function} from its original \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_space}{function space} into another function space via \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral}{integration}, where some of the properties of the original function might be more easily characterized \& manipulated than in the original function space. The transformed function can generally be mapped back to the original function space using the {\it inverse transform}.

\subsubsection{General form}
An integral transform is any transform $T$ of the form $(Tf)(u) = \int_{t_1}^{t_2} f(t)K(t,u)\,{\rm d}t$. The input of this transform is a function $f$, \& the output is another function $Tf$. An integral transform is a particular kind of mathematical operator. There are numerous useful integral transforms. Each is specified by a choice of the function $K$ of 2 variables, called the {\it kernel} or {\it nucleus} (hạt nhân) of the transform.

Some kernels have an associated {\it inverse kernel} $K^{-1}(u,t)$ which (roughly speaking) yields an inverse transform: $f(t) = \int_{t_1}^{t_2} (Tf)(u)K^{-1}(u,t)\,{\rm d}u$. A {\it symmetric kernel} is one that is unchanged when the 2 variables are permuted; it is a kernel function $K$ s.t. $K(t,u) = K(u,t)$. In the theory of integral equations, symmetric kernels corresponds to \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-adjoint_operators}{self-adjoint operators}.

\subsubsection{Motivation}
There are many classes of problems that are difficult to solve -- or at least quite unwieldy algebraically -- in their original representations. An integral transform ``maps'' an equation from its original ``domain'' into another domain, in which manipulating \& solving the equation may be much easier than in the original domain. The solution can then be mapped back to the original domain with the inverse of the integral transform.

There are many applications of probability that rely on integral transforms, such as ``pricing kernel'' or \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_discount_factor}{stochastic discount factor}, or the smoothing of data recovered from robust statistics, see \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_(statistics)}{kernel (statistics)}.

\subsubsection{History}
The precursor of the transforms were the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_series}{Fourier series} to express functions in finite intervals. Later the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_transform}{Fourier transform} was developed to remove the requirement of finite intervals.

Using the Fourier series, just about any practical function of time (e.g., the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voltage}{voltage} across the terminals of an \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_device}{electronic device}) can be represented as a sum of sines \& cosines, each suitably scaled (multiplied by a constant factor), shifted (advanced or retarded in time) \& ``squeezed'' or ``stretched'' (increasing or decreasing the frequency). The sines \& cosines in the Fourier series are an example of an \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthonormal_basis}{orthonormal basis}.

\subsubsection{Usage example}
As an example of an application of integral transforms, consider the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laplace_transform}{Laplace transform}. This is a technique that maps \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_equation}{differential} or \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integro-differential_equation}{integro-differential equations} in the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_domain}{``time'' domain} into polynomial equations in what is termed the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency_domain}{``complex frequency'' domain}. (Complex frequency is similar to actual, physical frequency but rather more general. Specifically, the imaginary component $\omega$ of the complex frequency $s = -\sigma + i\omega$ corresponds to the usual concept of frequency, viz., the rate at which a sinusoid cycles, whereas the real component $\sigma$ of the complex frequency corresponds to the degree of ``damping'', i.e., an exponential decrease of the amplitude.) The equation cast in terms of complex frequency is readily solved in the complex frequency domain (roots of the polynomial equations in the complex frequency domain correspond to \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eigenvalues}{eigenvalues} in the time domain), leading to a ``solution'' formulated in the frequency domain. Employing the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse_Laplace_transform}{inverse transform}, i.e., the inverse procedure of the original Laplace transform, one obtains a time-domain solution. In this example, polynomials in the complex frequency domain (typically occurring in the denominator) correspond to \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_series}{power series} in the time domain, while axial shifts in the complex frequency domain correspond to damping by decaying exponentials in the time doamin.

The Laplace transform finds wide application in physics \& particularly in electrical engineering, where the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Characteristic_equation_(calculus)}{characteristic equations} that describe the behavior of an electric circuit in the complex frequency domain correspond to linear combinations of exponentially scaled \& time-shifted \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damped_sinusoid}{damped sinusoids} in the time domain. Other integral transforms find special applicability within other scientific \& mathematical disciplines.

Another usage example is the kernel in the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Path_integral_formulation#Path_integral_in_quantum_mechanics}{path integral} $\psi(t,x)\coloneqq\int_\mathbb{R} \psi(t',x')K(t,x;t',x')\,{\rm d}x'$. This states that the total amplitude $\psi(t,x)$ to arrive at $(t,x)$ is the sum (the integral) over all possible values $x'$ of the total amplitude $\psi(t',x')$ to arrive at the point $(t',x')$ multiplied by the amplitude to go from $x'$ to $x$, i.e. $K(t,x;t',x')$. It is often referred to as the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propagator}{propagator} for a given system. This (physics) kernel is the kernel of the integral transform. However, for each quantum system, there is a different kernel.

\end{enumerate}
In the limits of integration for the inverse transform, $c$ is a constant which depends on the nature of the transform function. E.g., for the 1- \& 2-sided Laplace transform, $c$ must be greater than the largest real part of the zeros of the transform function. Note that there are alternative notations \& conventions for the Fourier transform.

\subsubsection{Different domains}
Here integral transforms are defined for functions on $\mathbb{R}$, but they can be defined more generally for functions on a group.
\begin{itemize}
	\item If instead one uses functions on the circle (periodic functions), integration kernels are then biperiodic functions; convolution by functions on the circle yields \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_convolution}{circular convolution}.
	\item If one uses functions on the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclic_group}{cyclic group} of order $n$ ($C_n$ or $\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}$), one obtains $n\times n$ matrices as integration kernels; convolution corresponds to \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulant_matrices}{circulant matrices}.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{General theory}
Although the properties of integral transforms vary widely, they have some properties in common. E.g., every integral transform is a \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_operator}{linear operator}, since the integral is a linear operator, \& in fact if the kernel is allowed to be a \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_function}{generalized function} then all linear operators are integral transforms (a properly formulated version of this statement is the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schwartz_kernel_theorem}{Schwartz kernel theorem}).

The general theory of such \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral_equation}{integral equations} is known as \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fredholm_theory}{Fredholm theory}. In this theory, the kernel is understood to be a \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_operator}{compact operator} acting on a Banach space of functions. Depending on the situation, the kernel is then variously referred to as the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fredholm_operator}{Fredholm operator}, the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_operator}{nuclear operator} or the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fredholm_kernel}{Fredholm kernel}.'' -- \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral_transform}{Wikipedia{\tt/}integral transform}

\subsection{Wikipedia{\tt/}minimal surface}
{\sf A \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helicoid}{helicoid} minimal surface formed by a soap film on a helical frame.} ``In mathematics, a {\it minimal surface} is a surface that locally minimizes its area. This is equivalent to having zero \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_curvature}{mean curvature}.

The term ``minimal surface'' is used because these surfaces originally arose as surfaces that minimized total surface area subject to some constraint. Physical models of area-minimizing minimal surfaces can be made by dipping a wire frame into a soap solution, forming a \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soap_film}{soap film}, which is a minimal surface whose boundary is the wire frame. However, the term is used for more general surfaces that may \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immersed_submanifold#Immersed_submanifolds}{self-intersect} or do not have constraints. For a given constraint there may also exist several minimal surfaces with different areas (e.g., see \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimal_surface_of_revolution}{minimal surface of revolution}): the standard definitions only relate to a \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_optimum}{local optimum}, not a \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_optimum}{global optimum}.

\subsubsection{Definitions}
{\sf\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saddle_tower}{Saddle tower} minimal surface. While any small change of the surface increases its area, there exist other surfaces with the same boundary with a smaller total area.} {\sf Minimal surface curvature planes. On a minimal surface, the curvature along the principal curvature planes are equal \& opposite at every point. This makes the mean curvature zero.} Minimal surfaces can be defined in several equivalent ways in $\mathbb{R}^3$. The fact that they are equivalent serves to demonstrate how minimal surface theory lies at the crossroads of several mathematical disciplines, especially \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_geometry}{differential geometry}, \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus_of_variations}{calculus of variations}, \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potential_theory}{potential theory}, \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_analysis}{complex analysis}, \& \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_physics}{mathematical physics}.

\begin{definition}[Local least area definition]
	A surface $M\subset\mathbb{R}^3$ is minimal iff every point $p\in M$ has a \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neighbourhood_(topology)}{neighborhood}, bounded by a simple closed curve, which has the least area among all surfaces having the same boundary.
\end{definition}
This property is local: there might exist regions in a minimal surface, together with other surfaces of smaller area which have the same boundary. This property establishes a connection with soap films; a soap film deformed to have a wire frame as boundary will minimize area.

\begin{definition}[Variational definition]
	A surface $M\subset\mathbb{R}^3$ is minimal iff it is a \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_point_(mathematics)}{critical point} of the area \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_(mathematics)}{functional} for all compactly supported \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus_of_variations}{variations}.
\end{definition}
This definition makes minimal surfaces a 2D analogue to \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geodesics}{geodesics}, which are analogously defined as critical points of the length functional.

\begin{definition}[Mean curvature definition]
	A surface $M\subset\mathbb{R}^3$ is minimal iff its \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_curvature}{mean curvature} is equal to zero at all points.
\end{definition}
A direct implication of this definition is that every point on the surface is a \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saddle_point}{saddle point} with equal \& opposite \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_curvatures}{principal curvatures}. By the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Young%E2%80%93Laplace_equation}{Young--Laplace equation}, the mean curvature of a soap film is proportional to the difference in pressure between the sides. If the soap film does not enclose a region, then this will make its mean curvature zero. By contrast, a spherical \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soap_bubble}{soap bubble} encloses a region which has a different pressure from the exterior region, \& as such does not have zero mean curvature.

\begin{definition}[Differential equation definition]
	A surface $M\subset\mathbb{R}^3$ is minimal iff it can be locally expressed as the graph of a solution of $(1 + u_x^2)u_{yy} - 2u_xu_yu_{xy} + (1 + u_y)^2u_{xx} = 0$.
\end{definition}
The PDE in this definition was originally found in 1762 by \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrange}{\sc Lagrange}, \& \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Baptiste_Meusnier}{\sc Jean Baptiste Meusnier} discovered in 1776 that it implied a vanishing mean curvature.

\begin{definition}[Energy definition]
	A \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conformal_map}{conformal} immersion $X:M\to\mathbb{R}^3$ is minimal iff it is a critical point of the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirichlet_energy}{Dirichlet energy} for all compactly supported variations, or equivalently if any point $p\in M$ has a neighborhood with least energy relative to its boundary.
\end{definition}
This definition ties minimal surfaces to \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonic_functions}{harmonic functions} \& \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potential_theory}{potential theory}.

\begin{definition}[Harmonic definition]
	If $X = (x_1,x_2,x_3):M\to\mathbb{R}^3$ is an \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isometry}{isometric} \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immersion_(mathematics)}{immersion} of a \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemann_surface}{Riemann surface} into 3-space, then $X$ is said to be \emph{minimal} whenever $x_i$ is a \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonic_function}{harmonic function} on $M$ for each $i$.
\end{definition}
A direct implication of this definition \& the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonic_functions#Maximum_principle}{maximum principle for harmonic functions} is that there are no \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_space}{compact} \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complete_metric_space}{complete} minimal surfaces in $\mathbb{R}^3$.

\begin{definition}[Gauss map definition]
	A surface $M\to\mathbb{R}^3$ is minimal iff its \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereographic_projection}{stereographically} projected \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauss_map}{Gauss map} $g:M\to\mathbb{C}\cup\{\infty\}$ is \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meromorphic}{meromorphic} w.r.t. the underlying \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemann_surface}{Riemann surface} structure, \& $M$ is not a piece of a sphere.
\end{definition}
This definition uses that the mean curvature is half of the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trace_(linear_algebra)}{trace} of the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shape_operator#Shape_operator}{shape operator}, which is linked to the derivative of the Gauss map. If the projected Gauss map obeys the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cauchy%E2%80%93Riemann_equations}{Cauchy--Riemann equations} then either the trace vanishes or every point of $M$ is \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umbilical_point}{umbilic}, in which case it is a piece of a sphere.

The local least area \& variational definitions allow extending minimal surfaces to other \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemannian_manifolds}{Riemann manifolds} than $\mathbb{R}^3$.

\subsubsection{History}
Minimal surface theory originates with {\sc Lagrange} who in 1762 considered the variational problem of finding the surface $z = z(x,y)$ of least area stretched across a given closed contour. He derived the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler\%E2\%80\%93Lagrange\_equation}{Euler--Lagrange equation} for the solution
\begin{equation}
	\frac{{\rm d}}{{\rm d}x}\frac{z_x}{\sqrt{1 + z_x^2 + z_y^2}} + \frac{{\rm d}}{{\rm d}y}\frac{z_y}{\sqrt{1 + z_x^2 + z_y^2}} = 0.
\end{equation}
He did not succeed in finding any solution beyond the plane. In 1776 \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Baptiste_Marie_Meusnier}{\sc Jean Baptiste Marie Meusnier} discovered that the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helicoid}{helicoid} \& \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catenoid}{catenoid} satisfy the equation \& that the differential expression corresponds to twice the mean curvature of the surface, concluding that surfaces with zero mean curvature are area-minimizing.

By expanding Lagrange's equation to $(1 + z_x^2)z_{yy} - 2z_xz_yz_{xy} + (1 + z_y^2)z_{xx} = 0$, \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaspard_Monge}{\sc Gaspard Monge} \& {\sc Legendre} in 1795 derived representation formulas for the solution surfaces. While these were successfully used by \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinrich_Scherk}{\sc Heinrich Scherk} in 1830 to derive his \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scherk_surface}{surfaces}, they were generally regarded as practically unusable. \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eug%C3%A8ne_Charles_Catalan}{\sc Catalan} proved in 1842{\tt/}43 that the helicoid is the only \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruled_surface}{ruled} minimal surface.

Progress had been fairly slow until the middle of the century when the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bj%C3%B6rling_problem}{Bj\"orling problem} was solved using complex methods. The ``1st golden age'' of minimal surfaces began. \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermann_Schwarz}{\sc Hermann Schwarz} found the solution of the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plateau_problem}{Plateau problem} for a regular quadrilateral in 1865 \& for a general quadrilateral in 1867 (allowing the construction of his periodic \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schwarz_minimal_surface}{surface families}) using complex methods. \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weierstrass}{\sc Weierstrass} \& \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Enneper}{\sc Enneper} developed more useful \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weierstrass%E2%80%93Enneper_parameterization}{representation formulas}, firmly linking minimal surfaces to \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_analysis}{complex analysis} \& \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonic_functions}{harmonic functions}. Other important contributions came from {\sc Beltrami, Bonnet, Darboux, Lie, Riemann, Serret, \& Weingarten}.

Between 1925 \& 1950 minimal surface theory revived, now mainly aimed at nonparametric minimal surfaces. The complete solution of the Plateau problem by \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesse_Douglas}{\sc Jesse Douglas} \& \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibor_Rad%C3%B3}{\sc Tibor Rad\'o} was a major milestone. \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernstein%27s_problem}{Bernstein's problem} \& \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Osserman}{\sc Robert Osserman}'s work on complete minimal surfaces of finite total curvature were also important.

Another revival began in the 1980s. 1 cause was the discovery in 1982 by {\sc Celso Costa} of \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Costa%27s_minimal_surface}{Costa's minimal surface} that disproved the conjecture that the plane, the catenoid, \& the helicoid are the only complete embedded minimal surfaces in $\mathbb{R}^3$ of finite topological type. This not only stimulated new work on using the old parametric methods, but also demonstrated the importance of computer graphics to visualize the studied surfaces \& numerical methods to solve the ``period problem'' (when using the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associate_family}{conjugate surface method} to determine surface patches that can be assembled into a larger symmetric surface, certain parameters need to be numerically matched to produce an embedded surface). Another cause was the verification by {\sc H. Karcher} that the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triply_periodic_minimal_surface}{triply periodic minimal surfaces} originally described empirically by {\sc Alan Schoen} in 1970 actually exist. This had led to a rich menagerie of surface families \& methods of deriving new surfaces from old, e.g. by adding handles or distorting them.

Currently the theory of minimal surfaces has diversified to minimal submanifolds in other ambient geometries, becoming relevant to mathematical physics (e.g., \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_mass_conjecture}{positive mass conjecture}, \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemannian_Penrose_inequality}{Penrose conjecture}) \& 3-manifold geometry (e.g., \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smith_conjecture}{Smith conjecture}, \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poincar%C3%A9_conjecture}{Poincar\'e conjecture}, \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thurston_Geometrization_Conjecture}{Thurston Geometrization Conjecture}).

\subsubsection{Generalizations \& links to other fields}
Minimal surfaces can be defined in other \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifolds}{manifolds} than $\mathbb{R}^3$, such as \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_space}{hyperbolic space}, higher-dimensional spaces or \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemannian_manifolds}{Riemannian manifolds}.

The definition of minimal surfaces can be generalized{\tt/}extended to cover \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constant-mean-curvature_surface}{constant-mean-curvature surfaces}: surfaces with a constant mean curvature, which need not equal zero.

The curvature lines of an isothermal surface form an isothermal net.

In \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_differential_geometry}{discrete differential geometry} discrete minimal surfaces are studied: \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplicial_complex}{simplicial complexes} of triangles that minimize their area under small perturbations of their vertex positions. Such discretizations are often used to approximate minimal surfaces numerically, even if no closed form expressions are known.

\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiener_process}{Brownian motion} on a minimal surface leads to probabilistic proofs of several theorems on minimal surfaces.

Minimal surfaces have become an area of intense scientific study, especially in the areas of \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_engineering}{molecular engineering} \& \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Materials_science}{materials science}, due to their anticipated applications in \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-assembly}{self-assembly} of complex materials. The \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoplasmic_reticulum}{endoplasmic reticulum}, an important structure in cell biology, is proposed to be under evolutionary pressure to conform a nontrivial minimal surface.

In the fields of \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_relativity}{general relativity} \& \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorentzian_manifold}{Lorentzian geometry}, certain extensions \& modifications of the notion of minimal surface, known as \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apparent_horizon}{apparent horizons}, are significant. In contrast to the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event_horizon}{event horizon}, they represent a \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curvature}{curvature}-based approach to understanding \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_hole}{black hole} boundaries.

Structures with minimal surfaces can be used as tents. {\sf Circus tent approximates a minimal surface.}

Minimal surfaces are part of the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_Design}{generative design} toolbox used by modern designers. In architecture there has been much interest in \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensile_structure}{tensile structures}, which are closely related to minimal surfaces. Notable examples can be seen in the work of \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frei_Otto}{\sc Frei Otto}, \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shigeru_Ban}{\sc Shigeru Ban}, \& \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zaha_Hadid}{Zaha Hadid}. The design of the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympiastadion_(Munich)}{Munich Olympic Stadium} by {\sc Frei Otto} was inspired by soap surfaces. Another notable example, also by {\sc Frei Otto}, is the German Pavilion at \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expo_67_pavilions}{Expo 67} in Montreal, Canada.

In the art world, minimal surfaces have been extensively explored in the sculpture of \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Engman}{\sc Robert Engman} (1927--2018), \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Longhurst}{\sc Robert Longhurst} (1949--), \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_O._Perry}{\sc Charles O. Perry} (1929--2011), among others.'' -- \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimal_surface}{Wikipedia{\tt/}minimal surface}

\subsection{Wikipedia{\tt/}nonlocal operator}
``In mathematics, a {\it nonlocal operator} is a mapping which maps functions on a topological space to functions, in such a way that the value of the output function at a given point cannot be determined solely from the values of the input function in any neighborhood of any point. An example of a nonlocal operator is the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_transform}{Fourier transform}.

\subsubsection{Formal definition}
Let $X$ be a \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_space}{topological space}, $Y$ a set, $F(X)$ a \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_space}{function space} containing functions with domain $X$, \& $G(Y)$ a function space containing functions with domain $Y$. 2 functions $u,v\in F(X)$ are called equivalent at $x\in X$ if there exists a neighborhood $N$ of $x$ s.t. $u(x') = v(x')$, $\forall x'\in N$. An operator $A:F(X)\to G(Y)$ is said to be local if $\forall y\in Y$, there exists an $x\in X$ s.t. $Au(y) = Av(y)$, $\forall u,v\in F(x)$ which are equivalent at $x$. A nonlocal operator is an operator which is not local. For a local operator it is possible (in principle) to compute the value $Au(y)$ using only knowledge of the values of $u$ in an arbitrarily small neighborhood of a point $x$. For a nonlocal operator this is not possible.

\subsubsection{Examples}
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_operator}{Differential operators} are examples of local operators. A large class of (linear) nonlocal operators is given by the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral_transform}{integral transforms}, such as the Fourier transform \& the Laplace transform. For an integral transform of the form $(Au)(y) = \int_X u(x)K(x,y)\,{\rm d}x$, where $K$ is some kernel function, it is necessary to know the values of $u$ a.e. on the support of $K(\cdot,y)$ in order to compute the value of $Au$ at $y$. An example of a \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singular_integral_operator}{singular integral operator} is the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractional_Laplacian}{fractional Laplacian} $(-\Delta)^sf(x) = c_{d,s}\int_{\mathbb{R}^d} \frac{f(x) - f(y)}{|x - y|^{d + 2s}}\,{\rm d}y$. The prefactor $c_{d,s}\coloneqq\frac{4^s\Gamma(\frac{d}{2} + s)}{\pi^{\frac{d}{2}}|\Gamma(-s)|}$ involves the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_function}{Gamma function} \& serves as a normalizing factor. The fractional Laplacian plays a role in, e.g., the study of nonlocal \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimal_surfaces}{minimal surfaces}.

\subsubsection{Applications}
Some examples of applications of nonlocal operators are:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_series}{Time series analysis using Fourier transformations}
	\item Analysis of \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamical_systems}{dynamical systems} using Laplace transformations

\subsection{Wikipedia{\tt/}operator (mathematics)}
``In mathematics, an {\it operator} is generally a \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Map_(mathematics)}{mapping} or \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)}{function} that acts on elements of a \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_(mathematics)}{space} to produce elements of another space (possibly \& sometimes required to be the same space). There is no general definition of an {\it operator}, but the term is often used in place of {\it function} where the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_of_a_function}{domain} is a set of functions or other structured objects. Also, the domain of an operator is often difficult to characterize explicitly (e.g. in the case of an \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral_operator}{integral operator}), \& may be extended so as to act on related objects (an operator that acts on functions may act also on \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_equation}{differential equations} whose solutions are functions that satisfy the equation). See \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operator_(physics)}{Wikipedia{\tt/}operator (physics)}.

The most basic operators are \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_map}{linear maps}, which act on \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space}{vector spaes}. Linear operators refer to linear maps whose domain \& range are the same space, e.g. from $\mathbb{R}^d\to\mathbb{R}^d$. Such operators often preserve properties, e.g. \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_function}{continuity}. E.g., \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differentiation_(mathematics)}{differentiation} \& \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indefinite_integration}{indefinite integration} are linear operators; operators that are built from them are called \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_operator}{differential operators}, \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral_operator}{integral operators} or integro-differential operators.

{\it Operator} is also used for denoting the symbol of a \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_operation}{mathematical operation}. This is related with the meaning of ``operator'' in \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_programming}{computer programming}, see \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operator_(computer_programming)}{Wikipedia{\tt/}operator (computer programming)}.
	
\subsubsection{Linear operators}
Main article: \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_operator}{Wikipedia{\tt/}linear operator}. The most common kind of operators encountered are {\it linear operators}. Let $U,V$ be \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space}{vector spaces} over some \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_(mathematics)}{field} $K$. A \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Map_(mathematics)}{mapping} $A:U\to V$ is \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_(mathematics)}{linear} if $A(\alpha{\bf x} + \beta{\bf y}) = \alpha A{\bf x} + \beta A{\bf y}$, $\forall{\bf x},{\bf y}\in U$, $\forall\alpha,\beta\in K$, i.e., a linear operator preserves vector space operations, in the sense that it does not matter whether you apply the linear operator before or after the operations of addition \& scalar multiplication. In more technical words, linear operators are \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphism}{morphisms} between vector spaces. In the finite-dimensional case linear operators can be represented by matrices in the following way. Let $K$ be a field, $U,V$ be finite-dimensional vector spaces over $K$. Select a basis ${\bf u}_1,\ldots,{\bf u}_n$ in $U$ \& ${\bf v}_1,\ldots,{\bf v}_m$ in $V$. Then let ${\bf x} = x^i{\bf u}_i$ be an arbitrary vector in $U$ (assuming \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einstein_convention}{Einstein convention}), \& $A:U\to V$ be a linear operator. Then $A{\bf x} = x^iA{\bf u}_i = x^i(A{\bf u}_i)^j{\bf v}_j$. Then $a_i^j\equiv(A{\bf u}_i)^j$, with all $a_i^j\in K$, is the matrix form of the operator $A$ in the fixed basis $\{{\bf u}_i\}_{i=1}^n$. The tensor $a_i^j$ does not depend on the choice of ${\bf x}$, \& $A{\bf x} = {\bf y}$ if $a_i^jx^i = y^j$. Thus in fixed bases $n$-by-$m$ matrices are in \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bijective}{bijective} correspondence to linear operators from $U\to V$.

The important concepts directly related to operators between finite-dimensional vector spaces are the ones of \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_rank}{rank}, \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Determinant}{determinant}, \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse_operator}{inverse operator}, \& \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eigenspace}{eigenspace}.

Linear operators also play a great role in the infinite-dimensional case. The concepts of rank \& determinant cannot be extended to infinite-dimensional matrices. This is why very different techniques are employed when studying linear operators (\& operators in general) in the infinite-dimensional case. The study of linear operators in the infinite-dimensional case is known as \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_analysis}{functional analysis} (so-called because various classes of functions form interesting examples of infinite-dimensional vector spaces).

The space of \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence}{sequences} of real numbers, or more generally sequences of vectors in any vector space, themselves form an infinite-dimensional vector space. The most important cases are sequences of real or complex numbers, \& these spaces, together with linear subspaces, are known as \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence_space}{sequence spaces}. Operators on these spaces are known as \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence_transformation}{sequence transformations}.

Bounded linear operators over a \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banach_space}{Banach space} form a \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banach_algebra}{Banach algebra} in respect to the standard operator norm. The theory of Banach algebras develops a very general concept of \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrum_(functional_analysis)}{spectra} that elegantly generalizes the theory of eigenspaces.

\subsubsection{Bounded operators}
Main articles: \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bounded_operator}{Wikipedia{\tt/}bounded operator}, \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operator_norm}{Wikipedia{\tt/}operator norm}, \& \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banach_algebra}{Wikipedia{\tt/}Banach algebra}. Let $U,V$ be 2 vector spaces over the same \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordered_field}{ordered field}, e.g., $\mathbb{R}$, \& they are equipped with \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norm_(mathematics)}{norms}. Then a linear operator from $U\to V$ is called {\it bounded} if there exists $c > 0$ s.t. $\|A{\bf x}\|_V\le c\|{\bf x}\|_U$, $\forall{\bf x}\in U$. Bounded operators form a vector space. On this vector space we can introduce a norm that is compatible with the norms of $U,V$: $\|A\|\coloneqq\inf\{c:\|A{\bf x}\|_V\le c\|{\bf x}\|_U\}$. In case of operators from $U$ to itself it can be shown that $\|AB\|\le \|A\|\|B\|$. Any unital \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normed_algebra}{normed algebra} with this property is called a \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banach_algebra}{Banach algebra}. It is possible to generalize \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectral_theory}{spectral theory} to such algebra. \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C*-algebra}{$C^\star$-algebras}, which are \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banach_algebras}{Banach algebras} with some additional structure, play an important role in \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics}{quantum mechanics}.

\subsubsection{Examples}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item {\sf Analysis (calculus).} Main articles: \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_operator}{Wikipedia{\tt/}differential operator} \& \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral_operator}{Wikipedia{\tt/}integral operator}. From the point of view of \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_analysis}{functional analysis}, \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus}{calculus} is the study of 2 linear operators: the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_operator}{differential operator} $\frac{{\rm d}}{{\rm d}t}$, \& the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volterra_operator}{Volterra operator} $\int_0^t$.
	\item {\sf Fundamental analysis operators on scalar \& vector fields.} Main articles: \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_calculus}{Wikipedia{\tt/}vector calculus}, \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_field}{Wikipedia{\tt/}vector field}, \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalar_field}{Wikipedia{\tt/}scalar field}, \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient}{Wikipedia{\tt/}gradient}, \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divergence}{Wikipedia{\tt/}divergence}, \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curl_(mathematics)}{Wikipedia{\tt/}curl}. 3 operators are key to \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_calculus}{vector calculus}:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Grad \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient}{gradient} (with operator symbol $\nabla$) assigns a vector at every point in a scalar field that points in the direction of greatest rate of change of that field \& whose norm measures the absolute value of that greatest rate of change.
		\item Div \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divergence}{divergence} (with operator symbol $\nabla\cdot$) is a vector operator that measures a vector field's divergence from or convergence towards a given point.
		\item \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curl_(mathematics)}{Curl} (with operator symbol $\nabla\times$) is a vector operator that measures a vector field's curling (winding around, rotating around) trend about a given point.
	\end{itemize}
	As an extension of vector calculus operators in physics, engineering \& tensor spaces, grad, div, \& curl operators also are often associated with \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor_calculus}{tensor calculus} as well as vector calculus.
	\item {\sf Geometry.} Main articles: \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_linear_group}{Wikipedia{\tt/}general linear group}, \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isometry}{Wikipedia{\tt/}isometry}. In \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometry}{geometry}, additional structures on \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space}{vector spaces} are sometimes studied. Operators that map such vector spaces to themselves bijectively are very useful in these studies, they naturally form \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_(mathematics)}{groups} by composition. E.g., bijective operators preserving the structure of a vector space are precisely the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invertible_function}{invertible} \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_operator}{linear operators}. They form the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_linear_group}{general linear group} under composition. However, they {\it do not} form a vector space under operator addition; since, e.g., both the identity \& -identity are invertible (bijective), but their sum $0$ is not. Operators preserving the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_metric}{Eucliean metric} on such a space form the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isometry_group}{isometry group}, \& those that fix the origin form a subgroup known as the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthogonal_group}{orthogonal group}. Operators in the orthogonal group that also preserve the orientation of vector tuples form the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_orthogonal_group}{special orthogonal group}, or the group of rotations.
	\item {\sf Probability theory.} Main article: \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_theory}{Wikipedia{\tt/}probability theory}. Operators are also involved in probability theory, e.g. \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expected_value}{expectation}, \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variance}{variance}, \& \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covariance}{covariance}, which are used to name both number statistics \& the operators which produce them. Indeed, every covariance is basically a \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_product}{dot product}: Every variance is a dot product of a vector with itself, \& thus is a \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_norm}{quadratic norm}; every standard deviation is a norm (square root of the quadratic norm); the corresponding cosine to this dot product is the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearson_correlation_coefficient}{Pearson correlation coefficient}; expected value is basically an integral operator (used to measure weighted shapes in the space).
	\item {\sf Fourier series \& Fourier transform.} Main articles: \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_series}{Wikipedia{\tt/}Fourier series}, \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_transform}{Wikipedia{\tt/}Fourier transform}. The Fourier transform is useful in applied mathematics, particularly physics \& signal processing. It is another integral operator; it is useful mainly because it converts a function on 1 (temporal) domain to a function on another (frequency) domain, in a way effectively invertible. No information is lost, as there is an inverse transform operator. In the simple case of \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodic_function}{periodic functions}, this result is based on the theorem that any continuous periodic function can be represented as the sum of a series of \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sine_wave}{sine waves} \& cosine waves: $f(t) = \frac{a_0}{2} + \sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n\cos\omega nt + b_n\sin\omega nt$. The tuple $(a_0,a_1,b_1,a_2,b_2,\ldots)$ is in fact an element of an infinite-dimensional vector space \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence_space}{$l^2$}, \& thus Fourier series is a linear operator. When dealing with general function $\mathbb{R}\to\mathcal{C}$, the transform takes on an \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral}{integral} form $f(t) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}}\int_{-\infty}^{+\infty} g(\omega)e^{i\omega t}\,{\rm d}\omega$.s

\subsection{Wikipedia{\tt/}operator algebra}
``In \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_analysis}{functional analysis}, a branch of mathematics, an {\it operator algebra} is an \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebra_over_a_field}{algebra} of continuous \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_operator}{linear operators} on a \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_vector_space}{topological vector space}, with the multiplication given by the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_composition}{composition of mappings}.

The results obtained in the study of operator algebras are often phrased in \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebra}{algebraic} terms, while the techniques used are often highly \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_analysis}{analytic}. Although the study of operators algebras is usually classified as a branch of functional analysis, it has direct applications to \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representation_theory}{representation theory}, \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_geometry}{differential geometry}, \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_statistical_mechanics}{quantum statistical mechanics}, \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_information}{quantum information}, \& \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_field_theory}{quantum field theory}.

\subsubsection{Overview}
Operator algebras can be used to study arbitrary sets of operators with little algebraic relation {\it simultaneously}. From this point of view, operator algebras can be regarded as a generalization of \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectral_theory}{spectral theory} of a single operator. In general, operator algebras are \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noncommutative_ring}{non-commutative} \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_(mathematics)}{rings}.

An operator algebra is typically required to be \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closure_(mathematics)}{closed} in a specified operator \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topology}{topology} inside the whole algebra of continuous linear operators. In particular, it is a set of operators with both algebraic \& topological closure properties. In some disciplines such properties are \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom}{axiomatized} \& algebras with certain topological structure become the subject of the research.

Though algebras of operators are studied in various contexts (e.g., algebras of \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudo-differential_operator}{pseudo-differential operators} acting on spaces of \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distribution_(mathematics)}{distributions}), the term {\it operator algebra} is usually used in reference to algebras of \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bounded_operator}{bounded operators} on a \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banach_space}{Banach space} or, even more specially in reference to algebras of operators on a \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separable_space}{separable} \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert_space}{Hilbert space}, endowed with the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operator_norm}{operator norm} topology.

In the case of operators on a Hilbert space, the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermitian_adjoint}{Hermitian adjoint} map on operators gives a natural \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Involution_(mathematics)}{involution}, which provides an additional algebraic structure that can be imposed on the algebra. In this context, the best studied examples are \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-adjoint}{self-adjoint} operator algebras, meaning that they are closed under taking adjoints. These include \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C*-algebra}{$C^\star$ algebras}, \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann_algebra}{von Neumann algebras}, \& \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AW*-algebra}{$\rm AM^\star$-algebras}. $C^\star$-algebras can be easily characterize abstractly by a condition relating the norm, involution, \& multiplication. Such abstractly defined $C^\star$-algebra can be identified to a certain closed \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subalgebra#Subalgebras_for_algebras_over_a_ring_or_field}{subalgebra} of the algebra of the continuous linear operators on a suitable Hilbert space. A similar result holds for von Neumann algebras.

\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commutative_algebra}{Commutative} self-adjoint operator algebras can be regarded as the algebra of complex-valued continuous functions on a \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locally_compact_space}{locally compact space}, or that of \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurable_function}{measurable functions} on a \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurable_space}{standard measurable space}. Thus, general operator algebras are often regarded as a noncommutative generalizations of these algebras, or the structure of the {\it base space} on which the functions are defined. This point of view is elaborated as the philosophy of \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noncommutative_geometry}{noncommutative geometry}, which tries to study various non-classical \&{\tt/}or pathological objects by noncommutative operator algebras.

Examples of operator algebras that are not self-adjoint include:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nest_algebra}{nest algebras}.

\subsection{Wikipedia{\tt/}physics-informed neural networks PINNs}
``{\it Physics-informed neural networks} (PINNs), also referred as as {\it Theory-Trained Neural Networks} (TTNs), are a type of universal function approximators that can be embed the knowledge of any physical laws that govern a given data-set in the learning process, \& can be described by PDEs. They overcome the low data availability of some biological \& engineering systems that makes most state-of-the-art machine learning techniques lack robustness, rendering them ineffective in these scenarios. The prior knowledge of general physical laws acts in the training of \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_network}{neural networks} (NNs) as a \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regularization_(mathematics)}{regularization} agent that limits the space of admissible solutions, increasing the correctness of the function approximation. This way, embedding this prior information into a neural network results in enhancing the information content of the available data, facilitating the learning algorithm to capture the right solution \& to generalize well even with a low amount of training examples. {\sf Physics-informed neural networks for solving NSEs.}

\subsubsection{Function approximation}
Most of the physical laws that govern the dynamics of a system can be described by PDEs. E.g., the NSEs are a set of PDEs derived from the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservation_law}{conservation laws} (i.e., conservation of mass, momentum, \& energy) that govern \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid_mechanics}{fluid mechanics}. The solution of the NSEs with appropriate initial \& boundary conditions allows the quantification of flow dynamics in a precisely defined geometry. However, these equations cannot be solved exactly \& therefore numerical methods must be used (e.g. FDs, FEs, \& FVs). In this setting, these governing equations must be solved while accounting for prior assumptions, linearization, \& adequate time \& space discretization.

Recently, solving the governing PDEs of physical phenomena using \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning}{deep learning} has emerged as a new field of scientific machine learning (SciML), leveraging the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_approximation_theorem}{universal approximation theorem} \& high expressivity of neural networks. In general, deep neural networks could approximate any high-dimensional function given that sufficient training data are supplied. However, such networks do not consider the physical characteristics underlying the problem, \& the level of approximation accuracy provided by them is still heavily dependent on careful specifications of the problem geometry as well as the initial \& boundary conditions. Without this preliminary information, the solution is not unique \& may lose physical correctness. On the other hand, physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) leverage governing physical equations in neural network training. Namely, PINNs are designed to be trained to satisfy the given training data as well as the imposed governing equations. In this fashion, a neural network can be guided with training data that do not necessarily need to be large \& complete. Potentially, an accurate solution of PDEs can be found without knowing the boundary conditions. Therefore, with some knowledge about the physical characteristics of the problem \& some form of training data (even sparse \& incomplete), PINN may be used for finding an optimal solution with high fidelity.

PINNs allow for addressing a wide range of problems in computational science \& represent a pioneering technology leading to the development of new classes of numerical solvers for PDEs. PINNs can be thought of as a meshfree alternative to traditional approaches (e.g., \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_Fluid_Dynamics}{CFD} for fluid dynamics), \& new data-driven approaches for model inversion \& system identification. Notably, the trained PINN network can be used for predicting the values on simulation grids of different resolutions without the need to be retrained. In addition, they allow for exploiting \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_differentiation}{automatic differentiation} (AD) to compute the required derivatives in the PDEs, a new class of differentiation techniques widely used to derive neural networks assessed to be superior to \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_differentiation}{numerical differentiation} or \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbolic_differentiation}{symbolic differentiation}.

\subsubsection{Modeling \& computation}
A general nonlinear PDE can be:
\begin{equation*}
	u_t + N[u;\lambda] = 0,\ {\bf x}\in\Omega,\ t\in[0,T],
\end{equation*}
where $u(t,{\bf x})$ denotes the solution, $N[\cdot;\lambda]$: a nonlinear operator parametrized by $\lambda$, \& $\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^d$. This general form of governing equations summarizes a wide range of problems in mathematical physics, e.g. conservative laws, diffusion process, advection-diffusion systems, \& kinetic equations. Given noisy measurements of a generic dynamic system described by the equation above, PINNs can be designed to solve 2 classes of problems:
\begin{itemize}
	\item data-driven solution
	\item data-driven discovery of PDEs.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Data-driven solution of PDEs.} The {\it data-driven solution of PDE} computes the hidden state $u(t,{\bf x})$ of the system given boundary data \&{\tt/}or measurements $z$, \& fixed model parameters $\lambda$. Solve:
\begin{equation*}
	u_t + N[u] = 0,\ {\bf x}\in\Omega,\ t\in[0,T].
\end{equation*}
By defining the residual $f(t,{\bf x})$ as $f\coloneqq u_t + N[u] = 0$, \& approximating $u(t,{\bf x})$ by a deep neural network. This network can be differentiated using automatic differentiation. The parameters of $u(t,{\bf x})$ \& $f(t,{\bf x})$ can be then learned by minimizing the following loss function $L_{\rm tot}\coloneqq L_u + L_f$ where $L_u\coloneqq\|u - z\|_\Gamma$ is the error between the PINN $u(t,{\bf x})$ \& the set of boundary conditions \& measured data on the set of points $\Gamma$ where the boundary conditions \& data are defined, \& $L_f\coloneqq\|f\|_\Gamma$ is the mean-squared error of the residual function. This 2nd term encourages the PINN to learn the structural information expressed by the PDE during the training process.

This approach has been used to yield computationally efficient physics-informed surrogate models with applications in the forecasting of physical processes, model predictive control, multi-physics \& multi-scale modeling, \& simulation. It has been shown to converge to the solution of the PDE.

\paragraph{Data-driven discovery of PDEs.} Given noisy \& incomplete measurements $z$ of the state of the system, the {\it data-driven discovery of PDE} results in computing the unknown state $u(t,{\bf x})$ \& learning model parameters $\lambda$ that best describe the observed data \& it reads as follows:
\begin{equation}
	u_t + N[u;\lambda] = 0,\ {\bf x}\in\Omega,\ t\in[0,T].
\end{equation}
By defining $f(t,{\bf x})\coloneqq u_t + N[u;\lambda] = 0$, \& approximating $u(t,{\bf x})$ by a deep neural network, $f(t,{\bf x})$ results in a PINN. This network can be derived using automatic differentiation. The parameters of $u(t,{\bf x}),f(t,{\bf x})$, together with the parameter $\lambda$ of the differential operator can be then learned by minimizing the following loss function $L_{\rm tot}\coloneqq L_u + L_f$ where $L_u\coloneqq\|u - z\|_\Gamma$, with $u,z$: state solutions \& measurements at sparse location $\Gamma$, respectively \& $L_f\coloneqq\|f\|_\Gamma$ residual function. This 2nd term requires the structured information represented by the PDEs to be satisfied in the training process.

This strategy allows for discovering dynamic models described by nonlinear PDEs assembling computationally efficient \& fully differentiable surrogate models that may find application in predictive forecasting, control, \& \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_assimilation}{data assimilation}.

\subsubsection{Physics-informed neural networks for piecewise function approximation}
PINN is unable to approximate PDEs that have strong nonlinearity or sharp gradients that commonly occur in practical fluid flow problems. Piecewise approximation has been an old practice in the field of numerical approximation. With the capability of approximating strong nonlinearity extremely light weight PINNs are used to solve PDEs in much larger discrete subdomains that increases accuracy substantially \& decreases computational load as well. DPINN (Distributed physics-informed neural networks) \& DPIELM (Distributed physics-informed extreme learning machines) are generalizable space-time domain discretization for better approximation. DPIELM is an extremely fast \& lightweight approximator with competitive accuracy. Domain scaling on the top has a special effect. Another school of thought is discretization for parallel computation to leverage usage of available computational resources.

XPINNs is a generalized space-time domain decomposition approach for the physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to solve nonlinear PDEs on arbitrary complex-geometry domains. The XPINNs further pushes the boundaries of both PINNs as well as Conservative PINNs (cPINNs), which is a spatial domain decomposition approach in the PINN framework tailored to conservation laws. Compared to PINN, the XPINN method has large representation \& parallelization capacity due to the inherent property of deployment of multiple neural networks in the smaller subdomains. Unlike cPINN, XPINN can be extended to any type of PDEs. Moreover, the domain can be decomposed in any arbitrary way (in space \& time), which is not possible in cPINN. Thus, XPINN offers both space \& time parallelization, thereby reducing the training cost more effectively. The XPINN is particularly effective for the large-scale problems (involving large data set) as well as for the high-dimensional problems where single network based PINN is not adequate. The rigorous bounds on the errors resulting from the approximation of the nonlinear PDEs (incompressible NSEs) with PINNS \& XPINNs are proved. However, DPINN debunks the use of residual (flux) matching at the domain interfaces as they hardly seem to improve the optimization.

\subsubsection{Physics-informed neural networks \& functional interpolation}
{\sf X-TFC framework scheme for PDE solution learning.} In the PINN framework, initial \& boundary conditions are not analytically satisfied, thus they need to be included in the loss function of the network to be simultaneously learned with the differential equation (DE) unknown functions. Having competing objectives during the network's training can lead to unbalanced gradients while using gradient-based techniques, which causes PINNs to often struggle to accurately learn the underlying DE solution. This drawback is overcome by using functional interpolation techniques such as the Theory of Functional Connections (TFC)'s constrained expression, in the Deep-TFC framework, which reduces the solution search space of constrained problems to the subspace of neural network that analytically satisfies the constraints. A further improvement of PINN \& functional interpolation approach is given by the Extreme Theory of Functional Connections (X-TFC) framework, where a single-layer Neural Network \& the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_learning_machine}{extreme learning machine} training algorithm are employed. X-TFC allows to improve the accuracy \& performance of regular PINNs, \& its robustness \& reliability are proved for stiff problems, optimal control, aerospace, \& rarefied gas dynamics applications.

\subsubsection{Physics-informed PointNet (PIPN) for multiple sets of irregular geometries}
Regular PINNs are only able to obtain the solution of a forward or inverse problem on a single geometry. It means that for any new geometry (computational domain), one must retrain a PINN. This limitation of regular PINNs imposes high computational costs, specifically for a comprehensive investigation of geometric parameters in industrial designs. Physics-informed PointNet (PIPN) is fundamentally the result of a combination of PINN's loss function with PointNet. In fact, instead of using a simple fully connected neural network, PIPN uses Pointnet as the core of its neural network. PointNet has been primarily designed for \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning}{deep learning} of 3D object classification \& segmentation by the research group of \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonidas_J._Guibas}{Leonidas J. Guibas}. PointNet extracts geometric features of input computational domains in PIPN. Thus, PIPN is able to solve governing equations on multiple computational domains (rather than only a single domain) with irregular geometries, simultaneously. The effectiveness of PIPN has been shown for \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incompressible_flow}{incompressible flow}, \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_transfer}{heat transfer}, \& \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_elasticity}{linear elasticity}.

\subsubsection{Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) for inverse computations}
Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have proven particularly effective in solving inverse problems within differential equations, demonstrating their applicability across science, engineering, \& economics. They have shown useful for solving inverse problems in a variety of fields, including nano-optics, topology optimization{\tt/}characterization, multiphase flow in porous media, \& high-speed fluid flow. PINNs have demonstrated flexibility when dealing with noisy \& uncertain observation datasets. They also demonstrated clear advantages in the inverse calculation of parameters for multi-fidelity datasets, meaning datasets with different quality, quantity, \& types of observations. Uncertainties in calculations can be evaluated using ensemble-based or Bayesian-based calculations.

\subsubsection{Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) with backward stochastic differential equation}
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_backward_stochastic_differential_equation_method}{Deep backward stochastic differential equation method} is a numerical method that combines deep learning with \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backward_stochastic_differential_equation}{Backward stochastic differential equation} (BSDE) to solve high-dimensional problems in financial mathematics. By leveraging the powerful function approximation capabilities of \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_neural_networks}{deep neural networks}, deep BSDE addresses the computational challenges faced by traditional numerical methods like FDMs or Monte Carlo simulations, which struggle with the curse of dimensionality. Deep BSDE methods use neural networks to approximate solutions of high-dimensional PDEs, effectively reducing the computational burden. Additionally, integrating Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) into the deep BSDE framework enhances its capability by embedding the underlying physical laws into the neural network architecture, ensuring solutions adhere to governing stochastic differential equations, resulting in more accurate \& reliable solutions.

\subsubsection{Physics-informed neural networks for biology}
An extension for adaptation of PINNs are Biologically-informed neural networks (BINNs). BINNs introduce 2 key adaptations to the typical PINN framework:
\begin{itemize}
	\item[(i)] the mechanistic terms of the governing PDE are replaced by neural networks, \&
	\item[(ii)] the loss function $L_{\rm tot}$ is modified to include $L_{\rm constr}$, a term used to incorporate domain-specific knowledge that helps enforce biological applicability.
\end{itemize}
For (i), this adaptation has the advantage of relaxing the need to specify the governing differential equation a priori, either explicitly or by using a library of candidate terms. Additionally, this approach circumvents the potential issue of misspecifying regularization terms in stricter theory-informed cases.

A natural example of BINNs can be found in cell dynamics, where the cell density $u(t,{\bf x})$ is governed by a reaction-diffusion equation with diffusion \& growth functions $D(u),G(u)$, respectively:
\begin{equation*}
	u_t = \nabla\cdot(D(u)\nabla u) + G(u)u,\ {\bf x}\in\Omega,\ t\in[0,T].
\end{equation*}
In this case, a component of $L_{\rm constr}$ could be $\|D\|_\Gamma$ for $D < D_{\min}$, $D > D_{\max}$, which penalizes values of $D$ that fall outside a biologically relevant diffusion range defined by $D_{\min}\le D\le D_{\max}$. Furthermore, the BINN architecture, when utilizing \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multilayer_perceptron}{multiplayer-perceptrons} (MLPs), would function as follows: an MLP is used to construct $u_{\rm MLP}(t,{\bf x})$ from model inputs $(t,{\bf x})$, serving as a surrogate model for the cell density $u(t,{\bf x})$. This surrogate is then fed into the 2 additional MLPs, $D_{\rm MLP}(u_{\rm MLP}),G_{\rm MLP}(u_{\rm MLP})$, which model the diffusion \& growth functions. Automatic differentiation can then be applied to compute the necessary derivatives of $u_{\rm MLP},D_{\rm MLP},G_{\rm MLP}$ to form the governing reaction-diffusion equation.

Note that since $u_{\rm MLP}$ is a surrogate for the cell density, it may contain errors, particularly in regions where the PDE is not fully satisfied. Therefore, the reaction-diffusion equation may be solved numerically, e.g. using a \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_of_lines}{method-of-lines approach}.

\subsubsection{Limitations}
Translation \& discontinuous behavior are hard to approximate using PINNs. They fail when solving differential equations with slight advective dominance \& hence asymptotic behavior causes the method to fail. Such PDEs could be solved by scaling variables. This difficulty in training of PINNs in advection-dominated PDEs can be explained by the Kolmogorov $n$-width of the solution. They also fail to solve a system of dynamical systems \& hence have not been a success in solving chaotic equations. 1 of the reasons behind the failure of regular PINNs is soft-constraining of Dirichlet \& Neumann boundary conditions which pose a multi-objective optimization problem which requires manually weighing the loss terms to be able to optimize. More generally, posing the solution of a PDE as an optimization problem brings with it all the problems that are faced in the world of optimization, the major one being getting stuck in local optima.'' -- \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics-informed_neural_networks}{Wikipedia{\tt/}physics-informed neural networks PINNs}

\subsection{Wikipedia{\tt/}spectral theory}
``In mathematics, {\it spectral theory} is an inclusive term for theories extending the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eigenvector}{eigenvector} \& \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eigenvalue}{eigenvalue} theory of a single \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square_matrix}{square matrix} to a much broader theory of the structure of \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operator_(mathematics)}{operators} in a variety of \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_space}{mathematical spaces}. It is a result of studies of \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_algebra}{linear algebra} \& the solutions of \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_of_linear_equations}{systems of linear equations} \& their generalizations. The theory is connected to that of \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytic_functions}{analytic functions} because the spectral properties of an operator are related to analytic functions of the spectral parameter.

\subsubsection{Mathematical backgrounds}
The name {\it spectral theory} was introduced by \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Hilbert}{\sc David Hilbert} in his original formulation of \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert_space}{Hilbert space} theory, which was cast in terms of \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_form}{quadratic forms} in infinitely many variables. The original \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectral_theorem}{spectral theorem} was therefore conceived as a version of the theorem on \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_axis_theorem}{principal axes} of an \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellipsoid}{ellipsoid}, in an infinite-dimensional setting. The later discovery in \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics}{quantum mechanics} that spectral theory could explain features of \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emission_spectrum}{atomic spectra} was therefore fortuitous. {\sc Hilbert} himself was surprised by the unexpected application of this theory, noting that ``I developed my theory of infinitely many variables from purely mathematical interests, \& even called it `spectral analysis' without any presentiment that it would later find application to the actual spectrum of physics.''

There have been 3 main ways to formulate spectral theory, each of which find use in different domains. After {\sc Hilbert}'s initial formulation, the later development of abstract \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert_space}{Hilbert spaces} \& the spectral theory of single \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_operator}{normal operators} on them were well suited to the requirements of physics, exemplified by the work of \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_von_Neumann}{\sc von Neumann}. The further theory built on this to address \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banach_algebra}{Banach algebras} in general. This development leads to the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gelfand_representation}{Gelfand representation}, which covers the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commutative_Banach_algebra}{commutative case}, \& further into \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-commutative_harmonic_analysis}{non-commutative harmonic analysis}.

The difference can be seen in making the connection with \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_analysis}{Fourier analysis}. The \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_transform}{Fourier transform} on the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_line}{real line} is in 1 sense the spectral theory of \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derivative}{differentiation} as a \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_operator}{differential operator}. But for that to cover the phenomena one has already to deal with \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_eigenfunction}{generalized eigenfunctions} (e.g., by means of a \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rigged_Hilbert_space}{rigged Hilbert space}). On the other hand, it is simple to construct a \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_algebra_of_a_locally_compact_group}{group algebra}, the spectrum of which captures the Fourier transform's basic properties, \& this is carried out by means of \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pontryagin_duality}{Pontryagin duality}.

One can also study the spectral properties of operators on \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banach_spaces}{Banach spaces}. E.g., \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_operator}{compact operators} on Banach spaces have many spectral properties similar to that of \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_(mathematics)}{matrices}.

\subsubsection{Physical background}
The background in the physics of \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vibration}{vibration} has been explained in this way:
\begin{quotation}
	Spectral theory is connected with the investigation of localized vibrations of a variety of different objects, from \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom}{atoms} \& \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule}{molecules} in chemistry to obstacles in \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waveguide_(acoustics)}{acoustic waveguides}. These vibrations have \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency}{frequencies}, \& the issue is to decide when such localized vibrations occur, \& how to go about computing the frequencies. This is a very complicated problem since every object has not only a \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_tone}{fundamental tone} but also a complicated series of \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtone}{overtones}, which vary radically from 1 body to another.
\end{quotation}
Such physical ideas have nothing to do with the mathematical theory on a technical level, but there are examples of indirect involvement (see e.g. \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Kac}{\sc Mark Kac}'s question \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Can_you_hear_the_shape_of_a_drum%3F}{\it Can you hear the shape of a drum?}). {\sc Hilbert}'s adoption of the term ``spectrum'' has been attributed to an 1897 paper of \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilhelm_Wirtinger}{\sc Wilhelm Wirtinger} on \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hill_differential_equation}{Hill differential equation} (by \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Dieudonn%C3%A9}{\sc Jean Dieudonn\'e}), \& it was taken up by his students during the 1st decade of the 20th century, among them \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erhard_Schmidt}{\sc Erhard Schmidt} \& \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frigyes_Riesz}{\sc Frigyes Riesz}. It was almost 20 years later, when \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics}{quantum mechanics} was formulated in terms of the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schr%C3%B6dinger_equation}{Schr\"odinger equation}, that the connection was made to \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_spectra}{atomic spectra}; a connection with the mathematical physics of vibration had been suspected before, as remarked by \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henri_Poincar%C3%A9}{\sc Henry Poincar\'e}, but rejected for simple quantitative reasons, absent an explanation of the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balmer_series}{Balmer series}. The later discovery in quantum mechanics that spectral theory could explain features of atomic spectra was therefore fortuitous, rather than being an object of {\sc Hilbert}'s spectral theory.

Formally, a strongly continuous semigroup is a representation of the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semigroup}{semigroup} $(\mathbb{R}_+,+)$ on some Banach space $X$ that is continuous in the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strong_operator_topology}{strong toperator topology}.'' -\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C0-semigroup}{Wikipedia{\tt/}$C_0$-semigroup}

	``Differential geometry is the detailed study of the {\it shape} of a surface (manifold), including {\it local} \& {\it global} properties. A plane in $\mathbb{R}^3$ is a very simple surface \& does not require many tools to characterize. An ``arbitrarily'' shaped surface, e.g., hood of a car, has many distinguished geometric features (e.g., highly curved regions, regions of near flatness, etc.). Characterizing these features quantitatively \& qualitatively requires the tools of differential geometry. Geometric details are important in many physical \& biological processes, e.g., surface tension, biomembranes.
	
	The framework of differential geometry is built by 1st defining a local map (i.e., surface parameterization) which defines the surface. Then, a calculus framework is built up on the surface analogous to the standard ``Euclidean calculus''. Other approaches are also possible, e.g., those with implicit surfaces defined by level sets \& distance functions. But parameterizations, though arbitrary, are quite useful in a variety of settings $\Rightarrow$ stick mostly with those. Emphasize: The geometry of a surface does not depend on a particular parameterization. Otherwise, we will emphasize the distinction between {\tt object 1} \& {\tt object 2}.
	
	We will use this ``abuse'' of notation when there is no possibility of ambiguity.
	
	{\bf Open set.} The concept of open set is critical in multivariate calculus to properly define differentiability. The notation for referencing boundaries of sets, as well as the closure of sets, is practical for referencing geometric details of solid objects \& their surfaces.
	
	{\bf Compactness.} Compact support is useful for ignoring boundary effects. This concept is needed to keep the ``action of a function'' away from the boundary of a set, or to localize the function in a region of interest. 1 reason is to avoid potential difficulties with differentiating a function at its boundary of definition. Or, more commonly, we wish to ignore a quantity depending on the value of a function at a boundary point, e.g., $\int_{\partial S} f = 0$ if $f$ has compact support in $S$.
	
	{\bf Topological mapping{\tt/}homeomorphism.} A bijective, continuous mapping $\boldsymbol{\Phi}$ whose inverse $\boldsymbol{\Phi}^{-1}$ is also continuous is called a {\it topological mapping} or {\it homeomorphism}. Point sets that can be topologically mapped onto each other are said to be {\it homeomorphic}. Sets that are homeomorphic have the ``same topology'', i.e., their connectedness is the same; they have the same kinds of ``holes''. See \cite[Sect. 2.3.1]{Walker2015} for what can happen when a mapping is not a homeomorphism.
	
	{\bf Rigid motion mapping.} A mapping $\boldsymbol{\Phi}$ is called a {\it rigid motion} if any pair of points ${\bf a},{\bf b}$ are the same distance apart as the corresponding pair $\boldsymbol{\Phi}({\bf a}),\boldsymbol{\Phi}({\bf b})$.
	
	{\bf Orthogonal Transformations.} Define the (affine) linear map $\boldsymbol{\Phi}$ (transformation)
	\begin{equation}
		\label{transformation}
		\widetilde{\bf x} = \boldsymbol{\Phi}({\bf x}) = A{\bf x} + {\bf b}.
	\end{equation}
	If $A$ satisfies the properties $A^{-1} = A^\top$, $\det A = 1$ then $\boldsymbol{\Phi}$ represents a rigid motion. Basically, $\boldsymbol{\Phi}$ consists of a rotation represented by $A$ followed by a translation represented by ${\bf b}$. A rigid motion can be used to transition from 1 Cartesian coordinate system to another. If ${\bf b} = {\bf 0}$ \& $A^{-1} = A^\top$, $\det A = 1$, then $\boldsymbol{\Phi}({\bf x}) = A{\bf x}$ is a linear map known as a {\it direct orthogonal transformation}, which is nothing more than a rotation of the coordinate system with the origin as the center. If $A^{-1} = A^\top$, $\det A = 1$ is replaced by $A^{-1} = A^\top$, $\det A = -1$, then $\boldsymbol{\Phi}({\bf x}) = A{\bf x}$ is called an {\it opposite orthogonal transformation}, which consists of a rotation about the origin \& a reflection in a plane. Both $A^{-1} = A^\top$, $\det A = \pm1$ are examples of {\it orthogonal matrices}.
	
	{\bf Interpretation of transformations.} Can interpret $\widetilde{\bf x} = \boldsymbol{\Phi}({\bf x}) = A{\bf x} + {\bf b}$ in 2 different ways. Consider a point $P\in\mathbb{R}^3$ with coordinates ${\bf x}$:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item {\it Alias} (Euler perspective). Viewing \eqref{transformation} as a transformation of coordinates, it appears that ${\bf x},\widetilde{\bf x}$ are the coordinates of the same point w.r.t. 2 different coordinate systems, equivalently, the point is referenced by 2 different ``names'' (sets of coordinates).
		\item {\it Alibi} (Lagrange perspective). Viewing \eqref{transformation} as a mapping of sets, it appears that ${\bf x},\widetilde{\bf x}$ are the coordinates of 2 different points w.r.t. the same coordinate system, equivalently, the point at $\widetilde{\bf x}$ ``was previously'' at ${\bf x}$ before applying the map.
	\end{itemize}
	The concept of material point is directly related to the alibi viewpoint. One can think of a ``particle'' of material, i.e., {\it material point}, initially located at ${\bf x}$, that then moves to $\widetilde{\bf x}$ because of some physical process. The transformation \eqref{transformation} simply represents the kinematic outcome of that physical process, which is a standard concept in deformable continuum mechanics, especially nonlinear elasticity.
	
	{\bf General transformations.} In general, transformation may not be linear. The alias viewpoint yields a {\it curvilinear} coordinate system. The alibi viewpoint implies that the set $S$ is {\it deformed} into the set $S' = \boldsymbol{\Phi}(S)$. 
	
	{\bf Parametric approach -- what is a surface?} A {\it surface} is a set of points in space that is ``regular enough''. A random scattering of points in space does not match our intuitive notion of what a surface is, i.e., it is not regular enough. The boundary of a sphere does match our notion of a surface, i.e., regular enough to be a surface because a sphere is ``smooth''. {\it Intuition}: Can think of creating a surface as deforming a flat rubber sheet into a curved sheet. Let $U\subset\mathbb{R}^2$ be a ``flat'' domain \& let ${\bf X}:U\to\mathbb{R}^3$ be this deforming transformation, i.e., for each point $(s_1,s_2)^\top\in U$ there is a corresponding point ${\bf x} = (x_1,x_2,x_3)^\top\in\mathbb{R}^3$ s.t. ${\bf x} = {\bf X}(s_1,s_2)$. Let $\Gamma = {\bf X}(U)$ denote the surface obtained from ``deforming'' $U$. Call ${\bf x} = {\bf X}(s_1,s_2)$ a {\it parametric representation} of the surface $\Gamma$, where $s_1,s_2$ are called the {\it parameters} of the representation. Refer to $U$ as a {\it reference} domain.
	
	{\bf Allowable parameterization{\tt/}immersion.} If use ${\bf x} = {\bf X}(s_1,s_2)$ to define surfaces, then we must place assumptions on ${\bf X}$ to guarantee that $\Gamma = {\bf X}(U)$ is a valid surface. At the bare minimum, ${\bf X}$ must be continuous to avoid ``tearing'' the rubber sheet. But if want to perform calculus on $\Gamma$, need more:
	\begin{assumption}[Regularity assumptions on ${\bf X}$]
		An allowable parameterization{\tt/}immersion is a parameterization of the form ${\bf x} = {\bf X}(s_1,s_2)$ satisfying:
		\item[(A1)] The function ${\bf X}(s_1,s_2)\in C^\infty(U)$ \& each point ${\bf x} = {\bf X}(s_1,s_2)\in\Gamma$ corresponds to just 1 point $(s_1,s_2)\in U$, i.e., ${\bf X}$ is injective.
		\item[(A2)] The Jacobian matrix $J = [\partial_{s_1}{\bf X},\partial_{s_2}{\bf X}]$ is of rank $2$ on $U$, i.e., the columns of $J$ are linearly independent.
	\end{assumption}
	{\bf Regular surface.} The fundamental property that makes a set of points in $\mathbb{R}^3$ a surface is that it {\it locally looks like a plane} at every point. If you ``zoom into'' a surface, it should look flat. Definition defining a surface in terms of a parameterization is inadequate. Want to define a set in $\mathbb{R}^3$ that is ``intrinsically'' 2D \& is smooth enough so we can perform calculus on it, without regard to a specific parameterization.

\subsection{Calculus on Surfaces}
{\bf Goal.} Define \& develop the fundamental tools of calculus on a regular surface. Start with the notion of differentiability of functions defined only on a surface. Define the concept of vector fields in a surface. Then proceed to develop the gradient \& Laplacian operators w.r.t. a surface. These operators allow for alternative expressions of the summed \& Gaussian curvatures. Derive integration by parts on surfaces, i.e., the domain of integration is a surface. Conclude with some useful identities \& inequalities. Always take $\Gamma$: a regular surface, either with or without a boundary.

	``Functional analysis is the study of certain topological-algebraic structures \& of the methods by which knowledge of these structures can be applied to analytic problems.''
	
	The material of a theory should be fully adequate for almost all applications to concrete problems. \& this is what ought to be stressed in such a course: The close interplay between the abstract \& the concrete is not only the most useful aspect of the whole subject but also the most fascinating one.
	
	Many problems that analysts study are not primarily concerned with a single object such as a function, a measure, or an operator, but they deal instead with large classes of such objects. Most of the interesting classes that occur in this way turn out to be vector spaces, either with real scalars or with complex ones. Since limit processes play a role in every analytic problem (explicitly or implicitly), it should be no surprise that these vector spaces are supplied with metrics, or at least with topologies, that bear some natural relation to the objects of which the spaces are made up. The simplest \& most important way of doing this is to introduce a {\it norm}. The resulting structure is called a {\it normed vector space}, or a normed linear space, or simply a {\it normed space}.
	
	``The theory of distributions frees differential calculus from certain difficulties that arise because nondifferentiable functions exist. This is done by extending it to a class of objects (called {\it distributions} or {\it generalized functions}) which is much larger than the class of differential functions to which calculus applies in its original form. Here are some features that any such extension ought to have in order to be useful; our setting is some open subset of $\mathbb{R}^d$:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Every continuous function should be a distribution.
		\item Every distribution should have partial derivatives which are again distributions. For differentiable functions, the new motion of derivative should coincide with the old one. (Every distribution should therefore be infinitely differentiable $C^\infty$.)

The point of view of integration defined as a Riemann integral may be historically grounded \& useful in many areas of mathematics but is far from being adequate for the requirements of modern analysis since Riemann integral can be defined only for a special class of functions \& this class is not closed under the process of taking pointwise limits of sequence (not even monotonic sequences) of functions in this class.

``The useful \& far-reaching idea of Lebesgue \& others was to compute the $(n + 1)$-dimensional volume `in the other direction' by 1st computing the $n$-dimensional volume of the set where the function $> y$. This volume is a well-behaved, monotone nonincreasing function of $y$, which then can be integrated in the manner of Riemann. This method of integration not only works for a large class of functions (which is closed under taking pointwise limits), but it also greatly simplifies a problem that used to plague analysts: {\it Is it permissible to exchange limits \& integration?}'' -- \cite[Chap. 1, pp. 1--2]{Lieb_Loss2001}

Lebesgue integration theory is 1 of the great triumphs of 20th century mathematics \& is the culmination of a long struggle to find the right perspective from which to view integration theory.

\subsection{Wikipedia{\tt/}mean-field game theory}
``{\it Mean-field game theory} is the study of strategic decision making by small interacting \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agent_(economics)}{agents} in very large populations. It lies at the intersection of \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_theory}{game theory} with stochastic analysis \& \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_theory}{control theory}. The use of the term ``mean field'' is inspired by \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean-field_theory}{mean-field theory} in physics, which considers the behavior of systems of large numbers of particles where individual particles have negligible impacts upon the system. In other words, each agent acts according to his minimization or maximization problem taking into account other agents' decisions \& because their population is large we can assume the number of agents goes to infinity \& a representative agent exists.

In traditional \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_theory}{game theory}, the subject of study is usually a game with 2 players \& discrete time space, \& extends the results to more complex situations by induction. However, for games in continuous time with continuous states (differential games or stochastic differential games) this strategy cannot be used because of the complexity that the dynamic interactions generate. On the other hand with MFGs we can handle large numbers of players through the mean representative agent \& at the same time describe complex state dynamics.

This class of problems was considered in the economics literature by \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boyan_Jovanovic}{Boyan Jovanovic} \& \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_W._Rosenthal}{Robert W. Rosenthal}, in the engineering literature by Minyi Huang, Roland Malhame, \& \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_E._Caines}{Peter E. Caines} \& independently \& around the same time by mathematicians Jean-Michel Lasry \& \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre-Louis_Lions}{Pierre-Louis Lions}.

In continuous time a mean-field game is typically composed of a \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamilton%E2%80%93Jacobi%E2%80%93Bellman_equation}{Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation} that describes the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimal_control}{optimal control} problem of an individual \& a \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fokker%E2%80%93Planck_equation}{Fokker--Planck equation} that describes the dynamics of the aggregate distribution of agents. Under fairly general assumptions it can be proved that a class of mean-field games is the limit as $N\to\infty$ of an $N$-player \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nash_equilibrium}{Nash equilibrium}.

A related concept to that of mean-field games is ``mean-field-type control''. In this case, a \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_planner}{social planner} controls the distribution of states \& chooses a control strategy. The solution to a mean-field-type control problem can typically be expressed as a dual adjoint Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation coupled with \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fokker%E2%80%93Planck_equation}{Kolmogorov equation}. Mean-field-type game theory is the multi-agent generalization of the single-agent mean-field-type control.

\subsubsection{General Form of a Mean-field Game}
The system of equations
\begin{equation*}
	\left\{\begin{split}
		-\partial_tu - \nu\Delta u + H(x,m,Du) &= 0,\\
		\partial_tm - \nu\Delta m - \nabla\cdot(D_pH(x,m,Du)m) &= 0,\\
		m(0) &= m_0,\\
		u(T,x) &= G(x,m(T)),
	\end{split}\right.
\end{equation*}
can be used to model a typical Mean-field game. The basic dynamics of this set of equations can be explained by an average agent's optimal control problem. In a mean-field game, an average agent can control their movement $\alpha$ to influence the population's overall location by
\begin{equation*}
	dX_t = \alpha_tdt + \sqrt{2\nu}dB_t,
\end{equation*}
where $\nu$: a parameter, $B_t$: a standard Brownian motion. By controlling their movement, the agent aims to minimize their overall expected cost $C$ throughout the time period $[0,T]$:
\begin{equation*}
	C = \mathbb{E}\left[\int_0^T L(X_s,\alpha_s,m(s))\,{\rm d}s + G(X_T,m(T))\right],
\end{equation*}
where $L(X_s,\alpha_s,m(s))$ is the running cost at time $s$ \& $G(X_T,m(T))$ is the terminal cost at time $T$. By this definition, at time $t$ \& position $x$, the value function $u(t,x)$ can be determined as
\begin{equation*}
	u(t,x) = \inf_\alpha \mathbb{E}\left[\int_t^T L(X_s,\alpha_s,m(s))\,{\rm d}s + G(X_T,m(T))\right].
\end{equation*}
Given the definition of the value function $u(t,x)$, it can be tracked by the Hamilton-Jacobi equation. The optimal action of the average players $\alpha^*(t,x)$ can be determined as $\alpha^*(t,x) = D_pH(x,m,Du)$. As all agents are relatively small \& cannot single-handedly change the dynamics of the population, they will individually adapt the optimal control \& the population would move in that way. This is similar to a Nash Equilibrium, in which all agents act in response to a specific set of others' strategies. The optimal control solution then leads to the Kolmogorov-Fokker-Planck equation $\partial_tm - \nu\Delta m - \nabla\cdot(D_pH(x,m,Du)m) = 0$.

\subsubsection{Finite State Games}
A prominent category of mean field is games with a finite number of states \& a finite number of actions per player. For those games, the analog of the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation is the Bellman equation, \& the discrete version of the Fokker-Planck equation is the Kolmogorov equation. Specifically, for discrete-time models, the players' strategy is the Kolmogorv equation's probability matrix. In continuous time models, players have the ability to control the transition rate matrix.

A discrete mean field game can be defined by a tuple $\mathcal{G} = (\mathcal{E},\mathcal{A},\{Q_a\},{\bf m}_0,\{c_a\},\beta)$ where $\mathcal{E}$ is the state space, $\mathcal{A}$ the action set, $Q_a$ the transition rate matrices, ${\bf m}_0$ the initial state, $\{c_a\}$ the cost functions \& $\beta\in\mathbb{R}$ a discount factor. Furthermore, a mixed strategy is a measurable function $\pi:\mathbb{R}^+\times\mathbb{E}\to\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{A})$, that associates to each state $i\in\mathcal{E}$ \& each time $t\ge0$ a probability measure $\pi_i(t)\in\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{A})$ on the set of possible actions. Thus $\pi_{i,a}(t)$ is the probability that, at time $t$ a player in state $i$ takes action $a$, under strategy $\pi$. Additionally, rate matrices $\{Q_a({\bf m}^\pi(t))\}_{a\in\mathcal{A}}$ define the evolution over the time of population distribution, where ${\bf m}^\pi(t)\in\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{E})$ is the population distribution at time $t$.

\subsubsection{Linear-quadratic Gaussian game problem}
From Caines (2009), a relatively simple model of large-scale games is the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear%E2%80%93quadratic%E2%80%93Gaussian_control}{linear-quadratic Gaussian} model. The individual agent's dynamics are modeled as a \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_differential_equation}{stochastic differential equation}
\begin{equation*}
	dX_i = (a_iX_i + b_iu_i)dt + \sigma_idW_i,\ i = 1,\ldots,N,
\end{equation*}
where $X_i$: the state of the $i$th agent, $u_i$: control of the $i$th agent, $W_i$: independent \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiener_process}{Wiener processes} $\forall i = 1,\ldots,N$. The individual agent's cost is
\begin{equation*}
	J_i(u_i,\nu) = \mathbb{E}\left[\int_0^\infty e^{-\rho t}[(X_i - \nu)^2 + ru_i^2]\,{\rm d}t\right],\ \nu = \Phi\left(\frac{1}{N}\sum_{k\ne i}^N X_k + \eta\right).
\end{equation*}
The coupling between agents occurs in the cost function.

\subsubsection{General \& Applied Use}
The paradigm of Mean Field Games has become a major connection between distributed decision-making \& stochastic modeling. Starting out tin the stochastic control literature, it is gaining rapid adoption across a range of applications, including:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item {\bf Financial market.} Carmona reviews applications in financial engineering \& economics that can be cast \& tackled within the framework of the MFG paradigm. Carmona argues that models in macroeconomics, contract theory, finance, $\ldots$, greatly benefit from the switch to continuous time from the more traditional discrete-time models. He considers only continuous time models in his review chapter, including systemic risk, price impact, optimal execution, models for bank runs, high-frequency trading, \& cryptocurrencies.
	\item {\bf Crowd motions.} MFG assumes that individuals are smart players which try to optimize their strategy \& path w.r.t. certain costs (equilibrium with rational expectations approach). MFG models are useful to describe the anticipation phenomenon: the forward part describes the crowd evolution while the backward gives the process of how the anticipations are built. Additionally, compared to multi-agent microscopic model computations, MFG only requires lower computational costs for the macroscopic simulations. Some researchers have turned to MFG in order to model the interaction between populations \& study the decision-making process of intelligent agents, including aversion \& congestion behavior between 2 groups of pedestrians, departure time choice of morning commuters, \& decision-making processes for autonomous vehicle.
	\item {\bf Control \& mitigation of Epidemics.} Since the epidemic has affected society \& individuals significantly, MFG \& mean-field controls (MFCs) provide a perspective to study \& understand the underlying population dynamics, especially in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic response. MFG has been used to extend the SIR-type dynamics with spatial effects or allowing for individuals to choose their behaviors \& control their contributions to the spread of the disease. MFC is applied to design the optimal strategy to control the virus spreading within a spatial domain, control individuals' decisions to limit their social interactions, \& support the government's nonpharmaceutical interventions.'' -- \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean-field_game_theory}{Wikipedia{\tt/}mean-field game theory}

\subsection{Weak solution -- Nghiệm yếu}

\begin{definition}[Weak solution -- Nghiệm yếu]
	``In mathematics, a \emph{weak solution} (also called a \emph{generalized solution}) to an ODE or PDE is a function for which the derivatives may not all exist but which is nonetheless deemed to satisfy the equation in some precisely defined sense. There are many different definitions of weak solution, appropriate for different classes of equations. 1 of the most important is based on the notion of \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distribution_(mathematics)}{distributions}.'' -- \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weak_solution}{Wikipedia{\tt/}weak solution}
\end{definition}
``Avoiding the language of distributions, one starts with a differential equation \& rewrites it in such a way that no derivatives of the solution of the equation show up (the new form is called the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weak_formulation}{weak formulation}, \& the solutions to it are called {\it weak solutions}). Somewhat surprisingly, a differential equation may have solutions which are not differentiable; \& the weak formulation allows one to find such solutions.

Weak solutions are important because many differential equations encountered in modeling real-world phenomena do not admit of sufficiently smooth solutions, \& the only way of solving such equations is using the weak formulation. Even in situations where an equation does have differentiable solutions, it is often convenient to 1st prove the existence of weak solutions \& only alter show that those solutions are in fact smooth enough.'' -- \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weak_solution}{Wikipedia{\tt/}weak solution}

\begin{example}[1st-order wave equation]
	The 1st-order \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_equation}{wave equation} $\partial_tu + \partial_xu = 0$ in $\mathbb{R}^2$ with $u = u(t,x)$ has the weak form $\int_{\mathbb{R}^2} u\partial_t\varphi + u\partial_x\varphi\,{\rm d}t\,{\rm d}x = 0$ has a solution $u(t,x) = |t - x|$ which may be checked by splitting the integrals over region $\{x\ge t\}$ \& $\{x\le t\}$ where $u$ is smooth.
\end{example}
``The notion of weak solution based on distribution is sometimes inadequate. In the case of \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_system}{hyperbolic systems}, the notion of weak solution based on distributions does not guarantee uniqueness, \& it is necessary to supplement it with {\it entropy conditions} or some other selection criterion. In fully nonlinear PDE e.g. \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamilton%E2%80%93Jacobi_equation}{Hamilton-Jacobi equation}, there is a very different definition of weak solution called \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viscosity_solution}{\it viscosity solution}.'' -- \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weak_solution}{Wikipedia{\tt/}weak solution}

\subsubsection{General idea}
When solving a differential equation in $u$, one can rewrite it using a \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_function}{test function} $\varphi$ s.t. whatever derivatives in $u$ show up in the equation, they are ``transferred'' via integration by parts to $\varphi$, resulting in an equation without derivatives of $u$. This new equation generalizes the original equation to include solutions which are not necessarily differentiable. The approach illustrated above works in great generality. Consider a linear differential operator in an open set $W\subset\mathbb{R}^d$:
\begin{equation*}
	P({\bf x},\partial)u({\bf x}) = \sum a_\alpha({\bf x})\partial^\alpha u({\bf x}),
\end{equation*}
where the multi-index $\alpha = (\alpha_1,\ldots,\alpha_d)$ varies over some finite set in $\mathbb{N}^d$ \& the coefficients $a_\alpha$ are smooth enough functions of ${\bf x}\in\mathbb{R}^d$. The differential equation $P({\bf x},\partial)u({\bf x} = 0$ can, after being multiplied by a smooth test function $\varphi\in C_c^\infty(W)$ \& integrated by parts, be written as
\begin{equation*}
	\int_W u({\bf x})Q({\bf x},\partial)\varphi({\bf x})\,{\rm d}{\bf x} = 0,
\end{equation*}
where the differential operator $Q({\bf x},\partial)$ is given by the formula
\begin{equation*}
	Q({\bf x},\partial)\varphi({\bf x}) = \sum (-1)^{|\alpha|}\partial^\alpha[a_\alpha({\bf x})\varphi({\bf x})],
\end{equation*}
which is the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_adjoint}{formal adjoint} of $P({\bf x},\partial)$.

In summary, if the original (strong) problem was to find a $|\alpha|$-times differentiable function $u$ defined on the open set $W$ s.t. $P({\bf x},\partial)u({\bf x}) = 0$, $\forall{\bf x}\in W$ (a so-called {\it strong solution}), then an integrable function $u$ would be said to be a {\it weak solution} if $\int_W u({\bf x})Q({\bf x},\partial)\varphi({\bf x})\,{\rm d}{\bf x} = 0$, $\forall\varphi\in C_c^\infty(W)$.

Extend earlier known results to the singular case in which $\frac{3n - 2}{2n - 1} < p\le2 - \frac{1}{n}$.

	{\bf Keywords.} nonlocal diffusion, nonlinear equations, bounded domains, a priori estimates, positivity, boundary behavior, regularity, Harnack inequalities.
	
	{\bf Abstract.} Provide a quantitative study of nonnegative solutions to nonlinear diffusion equations of porous medium-type of the form $\partial_tu + \mathcal{L}u^m = 0$, $m > 1$, where the operator $\mathcal{L}$ belongs to a general class of linear operators, \& eqn is posed in a bounded domain $\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^N$. As possible operators: include 3 most common definitions of the fractional Laplacian in a bounded domain with zero Dirichlet conditions, \& also a number of other nonlocal versions. In particular, $\mathcal{L}$ can be a fractional power of a uniformly elliptic operator with $C^1$ coefficients. Since nonlinearity is given by $u^m$ with $m > 1$, eqn is degenerate parabolic.
	
	Basic well-posed theory for this class of equations was recently developed by Bonforte \& V\'azquez. Address regularity theory: decay \& positivity, boundary behavior, Harnack inequalities, interior \& boundary regularity, \& asymptotic behavior. All this is done in a quantitative way, based on sharp a priori estimates. Although focusing on fractional models, results cover also local case when $\mathcal{L}$ is a uniformly elliptic operator, \& provide new estimates even in this setting.
	
	A surprising aspect discovered: possible presence of nonmatching powers for long-time boundary behavior, i.e., when $\mathcal{L} = (-\Delta)^s$ is a spectral power of Dirichlet Laplacian inside a smooth domain, can prove that: (i) when $s > 2\left(1 - \frac{1}{m}\right)$, for large times all solutions behave as ${\rm dist}^{\frac{1}{m}}$ near the boundary; (ii) when $s\le2\left(1 - \frac{1}{m}\right)$, different solutions may exhibit different boundary behavior. This unexpected phenomenon is a completely new feature of nonlocal nonlinear structure of this model, \& not present in semilinear elliptic equation $\mathcal{L}u^m = u$.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item {\sf Sect. 1: Introduction.}
		\begin{goal}
			Address question of obtaining a priori estimates, positivity, boundary behavior, Harnack inequalities, \& regularity for a suitable class of weak solutions of nonlinear nonlocal diffusion equations of form $\partial_tu + \mathcal{L}F(u) = 0$ in $Q_\infty = (0,\infty)\times\Omega$, where $\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^N$ is a bounded domain with $C^{1,1}$ boundary, $N\ge2$ (results work also in 1D if fractional exponent $0 < s <\frac{1}{2}$. The interval $\frac{1}{2}\le s < 1$ requires some minor modifications preferred to avoid.), $\mathcal{L}$: a linear operator representing diffusion of local or nonlocal type, the prototype example being fractional Laplacian (class of admissible operators).
		\end{goal}
		Although arguments hold for a rather general class of nonlinearities $F:\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}$, for simplicity, focus on model case $F(u)\coloneqq u^m$ with $m > 1$.
		
		Use of nonlocal operators in diffusion equations reflects the need to model presence of long-distance effects not included in evolution driven by Laplace operator: well documented in literature. Physical motivation \& relevance of nonlinear diffusion models with nonlocal operators. Because $u$ usually represents a density, all data \& solutions are supposed to be nonnegative. Since the problem is posed on a bounded domain, need boundary or external conditions assumed to be of Dirichlet type.
		
		Extensively studied when $\mathcal{L} = -\Delta,F(u) = u^m$, $m > 1$, eqn becomes classical PME. Here interested in treating nonlocal diffusion operators, in particular fractional Laplacian operators. Since working on a bounded domain, the concept of fractional Laplacian operator admits several nonequivalent versions, the best known being the restricted fractional Laplacian (RFL), the spectral fractional Laplacian (SFL), \& the censored fractional Laplacian (CFL). RFL is usually known as the {\it standard fractional Laplacian}, or plainly fractional Laplacian, \& the CFL is often called the {\it regional fractional Laplacian}.
		
		The case of SFL operator with $F(u) = u^m$, $m > 1$, was already studied in [Bonforte \& Vázquez 2015; 2016]. In [Bonforte \& Vázquez 2016] presented a rather abstract setting where they were able to treat not only usual fractional Laplacians but also a large number of variants listed. Rather general increasing nonlinearities $F$ were allowed. Basic questions of existence \& uniqueness of suitable solutions for this problem were solved in [Bonforte \& Vázquez 2016] in the class of ``weak dual solutions'', an extension of the concept of solution introduced in [Bonforte \& Vázquez 2015] having proved to be quite flexible \& efficient. Derived a number of a priori estimates (absolute bounds \& smoothing effects) in that generality.
		
		Since these basic facts are settled, here focus on finer aspects of theory, mainly sharp boundary estimates \& decay estimates. Such upper \& lower bounds will be formulated in terms of 1st eigenfunction $\Phi_1$ of $\mathcal{L}$, which under our assumptions will satisfy $\Phi_1\asymp{\rm dist}(\cdot,\Gamma)^\gamma$ for a certain characteristics power $\gamma\in(0,1]$ depending on particular operator being considered. Typical values: $\gamma = s$ (SFL), $\gamma = 1$ (RFL), $\gamma = s - \frac{1}{2}$ for $s > \frac{1}{2}$ (CFL) $\Rightarrow$ get various kinds of local \& global Harnack-type inequalities.
		
		Some of the boundary estimates obtained for parabolic case are essentially elliptic in nature. Study of this issue for stationary problems is done in a companion paper [Bonforte et al. 2017b]. Advantage: many arguments are clearer, since parabolic problem is more complicated than elliptic one. Clarifying such differences is 1 of main contributions. Prove both interior \& boundary regularity, \& to find large-time asymptotic behavior of solutions.
		
		{\sf Notation.} Some notation of general use. Notation $a\asymp b$ whenever there exist universal constants $c_0,c_1 > 0$ s.t. $c_0b\le a\le c_1b$. $a\lor b = \max\{a,b\},a\land b = \min\{a,b\}$. Always consider bounded domains $\Omega$ with boundary of class $C^2$. Use short form ``solution'' to mean ``weak dual solution'', unless differently stated.
		
		{\bf Presentation of results on sharp boundary behavior.} A basic principle: sharp boundary estimates depend not only on $\mathcal{L}$ but also on behavior of nonlinearity $F(u)$ near $u = 0$, i.e., on exponent $m > 1$. [$\ldots$]
		
		{\bf Asymptotic behavior \& regularity.}
		\item {\sf Sect. 2: General class of operators \& their kernels.} The interest of theory developed here lies both in the sharpness of results \& in wide range of applicability. Mentioned most relevant examples appearing in literature. Theory applies to a general class of operators with definite assumptions. Properties having to be assumed on class of admissible operators, which some of them already appeared in [Bonforte \& Vázquez 2016]. To further develop theory, need to introduce more hypotheses. [Bonforte \& Vázquez 2016] only uses properties of Green function, here make some assumptions also on kernel of $\mathcal{L}$ whenever it exists. Assumptions on the kernel $K$ of $\mathcal{L}$ are needed for positivity results, because need to distinguish between local \& nonlocal cases. Perform study of kernel $K$.

	\begin{itemize}
		\item {\sf Sect 1. Intro.} Several phenomena, from physics to biology to finance, exhibit events during which fractional behavior \& memory effects become predominant; e.g., viscoelastic materials (whose response depends on their current \& past states), certain geographical processes including movement of groundwater or transportation through porous media, neuronal \& gene regulation networks, but also control theory \& more recent modeling of financial market. Fractional calculus provides a reliable tools to describe memory effects. In 1967 M. Caputo, in the context of modeling heterogeneous elastic fields, introduced the {\it Caputo time derivative} of order $\alpha$:
		\begin{equation}
			\label{Caputo time fractional derivative}
			D_t^\alpha f(t)\coloneqq\frac{1}{\Gamma(1 - \alpha)}\frac{\rm d}{{\rm d}t}\int_0^t \frac{f(\tau) - f(0)}{(t - \tau)^\alpha}\,{\rm d}\tau,\ \alpha\in(0,1).
		\end{equation}
		Caputo modeled certain type of fluid diffusing in porous media using this novel nonlocal operator. In these geothermal studies, Darcy's Law is adapted to describe fluids that may carry solid particles obstructing the pores, thus diminishing their size \& creating a pattern of mineralization. This phenomenon has recently been observed in various other types of porous materials, including building materials, \& zeolite.
		
		Systems where particles exhibit anomalous diffusion (sub- or super-diffusion behavior) often involve memory effects, e.g., diffusion in porous media, turbulent flows, \& biological transport processes. These applications require mathematical models allowing particles to do macroscopical long jumps (L\'evy flights), leading to the use of nonlocal operators in the spatial \& time variables. Many different mathematical models describing anomalous diffusion in a porous medium in literature. Main PDE:
		\begin{equation}
			\label{CPME}
			\tag{CPME}
			D_t^\alpha = -\mathcal{L}u^m,\ m > 0,
		\end{equation}
		\& includes a general class of densely defined operators $\mathcal{L}$ both of local \& nonlocal type. Eqn \eqref{CPME} is a {\it density dependent diffusion} resulting in a characteristic scaling $\frac{x}{t^{\frac{\alpha}{2 + d(m - 1)}}}$, whenever diffusion operator is $\mathcal{L} = -\Delta$.
		
		From a mathematical point of view, characteristic scaling of the wetting front variable in anomalous diffusion differs from 1 of classical Heat Eqn $\frac{x}{\sqrt{t}}$. Originally, Caputo derivative arose in linear setting to achieve a subdiffusive characteristic scaling of form $\frac{x}{t^{\frac{\alpha}{2}}}$ with $\alpha\in(0,1)$. Non-locality in time, or memory effect, represents a ``waiting time'' phenomenon typically derived within stochastic framework of Continuous Time Random Walk. \eqref{CPME} encompasses a wide variety of anomalous diffusion models combining local \& nonlocal spatial operators, Caputo fractional time derivative, \& $m$-power like nonlinearities for any $m > 0$. Provide a comprehensive qualitative \& quantitative study of \eqref{CPME}. Beside global well-posedness, main contributions are 3fold: (i) study of comparison principle \& time monotonicity formula, (ii) $L^p$-$L^\infty$ smoothing effects, (iii) optimal long time behavior. {\sf Surprising facts}: {\it regularity effects} \& {\it non-extinction in finite time} for all solutions of \eqref{CPME} when $m\in(0,1)$. Notably: memory effect slows down diffusion, minimizing relevance of nonlinearity parameter $m$ in ranges $m\in(0,1)$ \& $m > 1$. Diffusive nature of eqn still provides a regularization of solution, a feature previously unknown for nonlinear equations involving Caputo derivatives. All these results are new even for classical Laplacian $\mathcal{L} = -\Delta$ \& $\alpha\in(0,1)$.
		
		Within mathematical framework, prototype subdiffusive PDE is ``Heat Eqn with memory'':
		\begin{equation}
			\label{heat with memory}
			D_t^\alpha u = \Delta u.
		\end{equation}
		{\sf Vast literature.} well-posedness \& regularity in $\mathbb{R}^d$, optimal asymptotic decay for solutions of \eqref{heat with memory} for Cauchy problem in $\mathbb{R}^d$. For Dirichlet problem on bounded domains, long time decay estimates, also allowing for general operators with variable coefficients in space \& time. Global well-posedness of \eqref{CPME} with $m = 1$ for singular solutions on bounded domains. From a nonlinear perspective, consider several fractional nonlinear models \& obtain sharp decay estimates of $L^q$ norms using fractional ODEs techniques. Porous Medium with fractional pressure, associated to Caﬀarelli--Vázquez model studied in its Caputo derivative version. Develop a theory of fractional gradient flows in Hilbert spaces, analogous of Brezis-Komura theory with fractional time derivative. This theory provides well-posedness for both linear \& for nonlinear problems.
		
		Memory effects complicate analysis quite a lot. Memory effects somehow destroy semigroup structure, essential in the De Giorgi-Nash-Moser theory. A nontrivial adaptation of Green function method, achieved by employing novel time monotonicity estimates, a feature coming as a surprise in context of Caputo setting.
		
		To provide further insights about results, some numerology\footnote{the use of numbers to try to tell somebody what will happen in the future. số học.} is in order: asymptotic estimates correspond to known estimates in formal limit $m\to1$, which does not happen in the --formal-- limit $\alpha\to1^-$. Neither exponents of smoothing effects nor the ones in long time behavior estimates, correspond to known ones when $\alpha = 1$.

	{\bf Abstract.} Consider a class of porous medium type of equations with Caputo time derivative. Prototype problem: $D_t^\alpha u = -\mathcal{L}u^m$ posed on a bounded Euclidean domain $\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}N$ with zero Dirichlet boundary conditions. The operator $\mathcal{L}$ falls within a wide class of either local or nonlocal operators, \& nonlinearity is allowed to be of degenerate or singular type, namely, $0 < m < 1$ \& $m > 1$. Most general form of a variety of models used to describe anomalous\footnote{different from what is normal or expected. dị thường.} diffusion processes with memory effects, \& finds application in various fields, e.g., visco-elastic materials, signal processing, biological systems, \& geophysical science. Prove existence of unique solution \& new $L^p$-$L^\infty$ smoothing effects. The comparison principle, provided in the most general setting, serves as a crucial tool in the proof \& provides a novel monotonicity formula. Consequently, establish: regularizing effects from diffusion are stronger than memory effects introduced by fractional time derivative. Solution attains boundary conditions pointwise. Prove: solution does not vanish in finite time if $0 < m < 1$, unlike case with classical time derivative. Provide a sharp rate of decay for any $L^p$-norm of solution for any $m > 0$. Memory effects weaken the spatial diffusion \& mitigate the difference between slow \& fast diffusion.

	{\bf Abstract.} Consider high-dimensional equation $\partial_tu - \Delta u^m + u^{-\beta}\chi_{\{u > 0\}}$, extend \cite{Kawohl_Kersner1992} 1D case. Prove existence of a very weak solution (VWS) $u\in C([0,T];L_\delta^1(\Omega))$ with $u^{-\beta}\chi_{\{u > 0\}}\in L^1((0,T)\times\Omega)$, $\delta({\bf x})\coloneqq d({\bf x},\partial\Omega)$. Prove some pointwise gradient estimates for a certain range of the dimension $N$, $m\ge1$, $\beta\in(0,m)$, mainly when the absorption dominates over diffusion $1\le m < 2 + \beta$. Prove a new kind of universal gradient estimate when $m + \beta\le2$. Consider several qualitative properties (e.g. finite time quenching phenomena \& finite speed of propagation) \& study of Cauchy problem.
	
	\begin{goal}
		Extend to high-dimensional case \cite{Kawohl_Kersner1992} for a 1D degenerate diffusion equation with a singular absorption term. Study nonnegative solutions of possibly degenerate reaction-diffusion multi-dimensional problem $\partial_tu - \Delta u^m + u^{-\beta}\chi_{\{u > 0\}}$ in $(0,\infty)\times\Omega$, $u^m = 0$ on $(0,\infty)\times\Gamma$, $u(0,{\bf x}) = u_0({\bf x})$ in $\Omega$.
	\end{goal}
	$\Omega$: an open regular bounded domain of $\mathbb{R}^N$, e.g., with $\Gamma$ of calss $C^{1,\alpha}$ for some $\alpha\in(0,1]$, $N\ge1$, $m\ge 1$ ($m > 1$ corresponds to a typical slow diffusion) \& mainly $\beta\in(0,m)$ with some remarks for case $\beta\ge m$. Treat separately the case of whole space $\Omega = \mathbb{R}^N$. The absorption term $u^{-\beta}\chi_{\{u > 0\}}$ becomes singular (\& the diffusion becomes degenerate if $m > 1$) when $u = 0$, \& by this normalization, have $u(t,{\bf x}) = 0\Rightarrow u^{-\beta}\chi_{\{u > 0\}}(t,{\bf x}) = 0$. Boundary condition implies an automatic permanent singularity on $\Gamma$, in contrast to other related problems in which the singularity is permanently excluded of the boundary $u^m = 1$ on $(0,\infty)\times\Gamma$.  Change of unknown $v\coloneqq1 - u^m$ in semilinear case $m = 1$ leads to the formulation $\partial_tv - \Delta v = \frac{\chi_{\{v < 1\}}}{(1 - v)^\beta}$ on $(0,\infty)\times\Omega$. Study the associated Cauchy problem in $(0,\infty)\times\mathbb{R}^N$ can be regarded from 2 different points of view according to the assumptions made on the asymptotic behavior of the initial datum when $|{\bf x}|\to\infty$.	
	\begin{goal}
		Analyze problem of type (P) \& (CP) when $u_0({\bf x})\searrow0$ as $|{\bf x}|\to\infty$.
	\end{goal}
	{\sf Motivation.} Problem (P) was regarded as the limit case of regularized Langmuir--Hinshelwood model in chemical catalyst kinetics for elliptic- \& parabolic equations.
	
	{\sf Interesting point.} Solutions may raise to a free boundary defined as $\partial\{(t,{\bf x});u(t,{\bf x}) > 0\}$. (P1) denoted as a {\it quenching problem}. Appearance of a blow-up time for $\partial_tu$ at the 1st time $T_{\rm c} > 0$ in which $u(T_{\rm c},{\bf x}) = 0$ at some point ${\bf x}\in\Omega$.
	
	Case $\beta\ge m$ presents special difficulties when the free boundary $\partial\{(t,{\bf x});u(t,{\bf x}) > 0\}$ is a nonempty hypersurface, this set corresponds to the set of {\it rupture points} in study of thin films. This case $\beta\ge m$ also arises in the modeling of micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS), in which mainly $m = 1,\beta = 2$.

A \textit{mathematician} is someone who uses an extensive knowledge of \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics}{mathematics} in their work, typically to solve \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_problem}{mathematical problems}.

Mathematicians are concerned with \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number}{numbers}, \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data}{data}, \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantity}{quantity}, \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_structure}{structure}, \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space}{space}, \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_model}{models}, \& \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics#Change}{change}.

\subsubsection{History}
For broader coverage of this topic, see \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_mathematics}{History of mathematics}.

%
1 of the earliest known mathematicians was \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thales_of_Miletus}{Thales of Miletus} (c. 624--c.546 BC); he has been hailed as the 1st true mathematician \& the 1st known individual to whom a mathematical discovery has been attributed.[Boyer (1991), \textit{A History of Mathematics}, p. 43]

He is credited with the 1st use of deductive reasoning applied to geometry, by deriving 4 corollaries to \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thales%27_Theorem}{Thales' Theorem}.

%
The number of known mathematicians grew when \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagoras_of_Samos}{Pythagoras of Samos} (c. 582--c. 507 BC) established the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagoreans}{Pythagorean School}, whose doctrine it was that mathematics ruled the universe \& whose motto was ``All is number''.[Boyer 1991, ``\textit{Ionia \& the Pythagoreans}'', p. 49]

It was the Pythagoreans who coined the term ``mathematics'', \& with whom the study of mathematics for its own sake begins.

%
The 1st woman mathematician recorded by history was \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypatia}{Hypatia} of Alexandria (AD 350--415).

She succeeded her father as Librarian at the Great Library \& wrote many works on applied mathematics.

Because of a political dispute, the Christian community in Alexandria punished her, presuming she was involved, by stripping her naked \& scraping off her skin with clamshells (some say roofing tiles).[``\textit{Ecclesiastical History}, Bk VI: Chap. 15''. Archived from the original on 2014-08-14. Retrieved 2014-11-19.]

%
Science \& mathematics in the Islamic world during the Middle Ages followed various models \& modes of funding varied based primarily on scholars.

It was extensive patronage \& strong intellectual policies implemented by specific rulers that allowed scientific knowledge to develop in many areas.

Funding for translation of scientific texts in other languages was ongoing throughout the reign of certain caliphs,[Abattouy, M., Renn, J. \& Weinig, P., 2001. \textit{Transmission as Transformation: The Translation Movements in the Medieval East \& West in a Comparative Perspective}. Science in Context, 14(1-2), 1-12.] \& it turned out that certain scholars became experts in the works they translated \& in turn received further support for continuing to develop certain sciences.

As these sciences received wider attention from the elite, more scholars were invited \& funded to study particular sciences.

An example of a translator \& mathematician who benefited from this type of support was \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Khawarizmi}{al-Khawarizmi}.

A notable feature of many scholars working under Muslim rule in medieval times is that they were often polymaths.

Examples include the work on \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optics}{optics}, maths \& \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomy}{astronomy} of \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibn_al-Haytham}{Ibn al-Haytham}.

%
The \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance}{Renaissance} brought an increased emphasis on mathematics \& science to Europe.

During this period of transition from a mainly feudal \& ecclesiastical culture to a predominantly secular one, many notable mathematicians had other occupations: \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luca_Pacioli}{Luca Pacioli} (founder of \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accounting}{accounting}); \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niccol%C3%B2_Fontana_Tartaglia}{Niccolò Fontana Tartaglia} (notable engineer \& bookkeeper); \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerolamo_Cardano}{Gerolamo Cardano} (earliest founder of probability \& binomial expansion); \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Recorde}{Robert Recorde} (physician) \& \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fran%C3%A7ois_Vi%C3%A8te}{François Viète}s (lawyer). 

%
As time passed, many mathematicians gravitated towards universities.

An emphasis on free thinking \& experimentation had begun in Britain's oldest universities beginning in the 17th century at Oxford with the scientists \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Hooke}{Robert Hooke} \& \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Boyle}{Robert Boyle}, \& at Cambridge where \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton}{Isaac Newton} was \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucasian_Professor_of_Mathematics}{Lucasian Professor of Mathematics \& Physics}.

Moving into the 19th century, the objective of universities all across Europe evolved from teaching the ``\textit{regurgitation of knowledge}'' to ``\textit{encourag[ing] productive thinking}.''[Röhrs, ``\textit{The Classical Idea of the University},'' Tradition \& Reform of the University under an International Perspective p. 20]

In 1810, Humboldt convinced the King of Prussia to build a university in Berlin based on \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Schleiermacher}{Friedrich Schleiermacher}'s liberal ideas; the goal was to demonstrate the process of the discovery of knowledge \& to teach students to ``\textit{take account of fundamental laws of science in all their thinking}.''

Thus, seminars \& laboratories started to evolve.[Rüegg, ``Themes'', \textit{A History of the University in Europe, Vol. III}, p. 5--6]

%
British universities of this period adopted some approaches familiar to the Italian \& German universities, but as they already enjoyed substantial freedoms \& \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomy}{autonomy} the changes there had begun with the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_Enlightenment}{Age of Enlightenment}, the same influences that inspired Humboldt.

The Universities of \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Oxford}{Oxford} \& \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Cambridge}{Cambridge} emphasized the importance of \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research}{research}, arguably more authentically implementing Humboldt's idea of a university than even German universities, which were subject to state authority.[Rüegg, ``Themes'', \textit{A History of the University in Europe, Vol. III}, p. 12]

Overall, science (including mathematics) became the focus of universities in the 19th \& 20th centuries.

Students could conduct research in \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seminars}{seminars} or \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratories}{laboratories} \& began to produce doctoral theses with more scientific content.[Rüegg, ``Themes'', \textit{A History of the University in Europe, Vol. III}, p. 13]

According to Humboldt, the mission of the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Berlin}{University of Berlin} was to pursue scientific knowledge.[Rüegg, ``Themes'', \textit{A History of the University in Europe, Vol. III}, p. 16]

\textit{The German university system fostered professional, bureaucratically regulated scientific research performed in well-equipped laboratories, instead of the kind of research done by private \& individual scholars in Great Britain \& France}.[Rüegg, ``Themes'', \textit{A History of the University in Europe, Vol. III}, p. 17--18]

In fact, Rüegg asserts that the \textit{German system is responsible for the development of the modern research university because it focused on the idea of ``freedom of scientific research, teaching \& study.''}[Rüegg, ``Themes'', \textit{A History of the University in Europe, Vol. III}, p. 31]

\subsubsection{Required education}
Mathematicians usually cover a breadth of topics within mathematics in their \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undergraduate_education}{undergraduate education}, \& then proceed to specialize in topics of their own choice at the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graduate-level}{graduate level}.

In some universities, a \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualifying_exam}{qualifying exam} serves to test both the breadth \& depth of a student's understanding of mathematics; the students, who pass, are permitted to work on a \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctoral_dissertation}{doctoral dissertation}.

\subsubsection{Activities}
\textsf{\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmy_Noether}{Emmy Noether}, mathematical theorist \& teacher.}

\paragraph{Applied mathematics.} Main article: \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applied_mathematics}{Applied mathematics}. Mathematicians involved with solving problems with applications in real life are called \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applied_mathematician}{applied mathematicians}.

Applied mathematicians are mathematical scientists who, with their specialized knowledge \& \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional}{professional} methodology, approach many of the imposing problems presented in related scientific fields.

With professional focus on a wide variety of problems, theoretical systems, \& localized constructs, applied mathematicians work regularly in the study \& formulation of \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_models}{mathematical models}.

Mathematicians \& applied mathematicians are considered to be 2 of the STEM (science, technology, engineering, \& mathematics) careers.

%
The discipline of \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applied_mathematics}{applied mathematics} concerns itself with mathematical methods that are typically used in science, engineering, business, \& industry; thus, ``applied mathematics'' is a \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_science}{mathematical science} with specialized knowledge.

The term ``applied mathematics'' also describes the professional specialty in which mathematicians work on problems, often concrete but sometimes abstract.

As professionals focused on problem solving, \textit{applied mathematicians} look into the \textit{formulation, study}, \& \textit{use of mathematical models} in \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science}{science}, \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering}{engineering}, \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business}{business}, \& other areas of mathematical practice.

\paragraph{Abstract mathematics.} Main article: \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_mathematics}{Pure mathematics}. \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_mathematics}{Pure mathematics} is mathematics that studies entirely abstract \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concept}{concepts}.

From the 18th century onwards, this was a recognized category of mathematical activity, sometimes characterized as \textit{speculative mathematics},[See for example titles of works by Thomas Simpson from the mid-18th century: \textit{Essays on Several Curious \& Useful Subjects in Speculative \& Mixed Mathematics, Miscellaneous Tracts on Some Curious \& Very Interesting Subjects in Mechanics, Physical Astronomy \& Speculative Mathematics. Chisholm}, Hugh, ed. (1911). ``Simpson, Thomas''. Encyclop\ae dia Britannica. 25 (11th ed.). Cambridge University Press. p. 135.] \& at variance with the trend towards meeting the needs of \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navigation}{navigation}, \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomy}{astronomy}, \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics}{physics}, \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economics}{economics}, \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering}{engineering}, \& other applications.

%
Another insightful view put forth is that \textit{pure mathematics is not necessarily \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applied_mathematics}{applied mathematics}}: it is possible to study abstract entities w.r.t. their intrinsic nature, \& not be concerned with how they manifest in the real world.[Andy Magid, \textit{Letter from the Editor, in Notices of the AMS}, Nov 2005, American Mathematical Society, p. 1173. [1] Archived 2016-03-03 at the Wayback Machine]

\textit{Even though the pure \& applied viewpoints are distinct philosophical positions, in practice there is much overlap in the activity of pure \& applied mathematicians}.

%
\textit{To develop accurate models for describing the real world, many applied mathematicians draw on tools \& techniques that are often considered to be ``pure'' mathematics}.

\textit{On the other hand, many pure mathematicians draw on natural \& social phenomena as inspiration for their abstract research}.

\paragraph{Mathematics teaching.} Many professional mathematicians also engage in the teaching of mathematics.

Duties may include:
\begin{itemize}
	\item teaching university mathematics courses;
	\item supervising undergraduate \& graduate research; and
	\item serving on academic committees.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Consulting.} Many careers in mathematics outside of universities involve consulting.

E.g., actuaries assemble \& analyze data to estimate the probability \& likely cost of the occurrence of an event such as death, sickness, injury, disability, or loss of property.

Actuaries also address financial questions, including those involving the level of pension contributions required to produce a certain retirement income \& the way in which a company should invest resources to maximize its return on investments in light of potential risk.

Using their broad knowledge, actuaries help design \& price insurance policies, pension plans, \& other financial strategies in a manner which will help ensure that the plans are maintained on a sound financial basis.

%
As another example, mathematical finance will derive \& extend the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_model}{mathematical} or \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_analysis}{numerical} models without necessarily establishing a link to \textit{financial theory}, taking observed market prices as input.

Mathematical consistency is required, not compatibility with \textit{economic theory}.

Thus, e.g., while a financial economist might study the structural reasons why a company may have a certain \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Share_price}{share price}, a financial mathematician may take the share price as a given, \& attempt to use \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_calculus}{stochastic calculus} to obtain the corresponding value of \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derivative_(finance)}{derivatives} of the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock}{stock} (see: \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valuation_of_options}{Valuation of options}; \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_modeling#Quantitative_finance}{Financial modeling}).

\subsubsection{Occupations}

\subsection{\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbert_Federer}{Wikipedia{\tt/}Herbert Federer}}
\textit{Herbert Federer} (Jul 23, 1920 -- Apr 21, 2010)[``NAS Membership Directory: Federer, Herbert''. National Academy of Sciences. Retrieved Jun 15, 2010.] was an American mathematician.

He is 1 of the creators of \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_measure_theory}{geometric measure theory}, at the meeting point of \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_geometry}{differential geometry} \& \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_analysis}{mathematical analysis}.[Parks, H. (2012) \href{http://www.ams.org/notices/201205/rtx120500622p.pdf}{\textit{Remembering Herbert Federer (1920--2010)}}, NAMS 59(5), 622--631.]

\subsubsection{Career}
Federer was born Jul 23, 1920, in \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vienna}{Vienna}, \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austria}{Austria}.

After emigrating to the US in 1938, he studied mathematics \& physics at the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California,_Berkeley}{University of California, Berkeley}, earning the Ph.D. as a student of \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Morse}{Anthony Morse} in 1944.

He then spent virtually his entire career as a member of the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_University}{Brown University} Mathematics Department, where he eventually retired with the title of Professor Emeritus.

%
Federer wrote more than 30 research papers in addition to his book \textit{Geometric measure theory}.

The \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics_Genealogy_Project}{Mathematics Genealogy Project} assigns him 9 Ph.D. students \& well over a hundred subsequent descendants.

His most productive students include the late \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick_J._Almgren,_Jr.}{Frederick J. Almgren, Jr.} (1933--1997) a professor at Princeton for 35 years, \& his last student, \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Miller_Hardt}{Robert Hardt}, now at Rice University.

%
Federer was a member of the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_National_Academy_of_Sciences}{National Academy of Sciences}.

In 1987, he \& his Brown colleague \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wendell_Fleming}{Wendell Fleming} won the American Mathematical Society's \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steele_Prize}{Steele Prize} ``for their pioneering work in \textit{Normal \& Integral currents}.''

\subsubsection{Normal \& integral currents}
Federer's mathematical work separates thematically into the periods before \& after his watershed 1960 paper \textit{Normal \& integral currents}, co-authored with Fleming.

That paper provided the \textit{1st satisfactory general solution to \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plateau's_problem}{Plateau's problem}} - the problem of finding a $(k + 1)$-dimensional least-area surface spanning a given $k$-dimensional boundary cycle in $n$-dimensional Euclidean space.

Their solution inaugurated a new \& fruitful period of research on a large class of \textit{geometric variational problems} - especially \textit{minimal surfaces} - via what came to be known as \textit{Geometric Measure Theory}.

\subsubsection{Earlier work}
During the 15 or so years prior to that paper, Federer worked at the technical interface of geometry \& measure theory.

He focused particularly on surface area, rectifiability of sets, \& the extent to which one could substitute rectifiability for smoothness in the analysis of surfaces.

His 1947 paper on the \textit{rectifiable subsets of $n$-space} characterized purely unrectifiable sets by their ``invisibility'' under almost all projections.

\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abram_Samoilovitch_Besicovitch}{A. S. Besicovitch} had proven this for 1-dimensional sets in the plane, but Federer's generalization, valid for subsets of arbitrary dimension in any Euclidean space, was a major technical accomplishment, \& later played a key role in \textit{Normal \& Integral Currents}.

%
In 1958, Federer wrote \textit{Curvature Measures}, a paper that took some early steps toward understanding 2nd-order properties of surfaces lacking the differentiability properties typically assumed in order to discuss curvature.

He also developed \& named what he called the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coarea_formula}{coarea formula} in that paper.

That formula has become a standard analytical tool.

\subsubsection{Geometric measure theory}
Federer is perhaps best known for his treatise \textit{Geometric Measure Theory}, published in 1969.[Goffman, Casper (1971). ``\href{http://www.ams.org/journals/bull/1971-77-01/S0002-9904-1971-12603-4/S0002-9904-1971-12603-4.pdf}{Review: Geometric measure theory, by Herbert Federer}'' (PDF). Bull. Amer. Math. Soc. 77 (1): 27--35. doi:10.1090/s0002-9904-1971-12603-4.]

Intended as both a text \& a reference work, the book is unusually complete, general \& authoritative: its nearly 600 pages cover a substantial amount of linear \& multilinear algebra, give a profound treatment of measure theory, integration \& differentiation, \& then move on to rectifiability, theory of currents, \& finally, variational applications.

Nevertheless, the book's unique style exhibits a rare \& artistic economy that still inspires admiration, respect - \& exasperation.

A more accessible introduction may be found in F. Morgan's book listed below.

\subsection{Godfrey Harold Hardy}
``{\sc Godfrey Harold Hardy} \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fellow_of_the_Royal_Society}{FRS} (Feb 7, 1877 -- Dec 1, 1947) was an English mathematician, known for his achievements in \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_theory}{number theory} \& \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_analysis}{mathematical analysis}. In \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology}{biology}, he is known for the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardy%E2%80%93Weinberg_principle}{Hardy--Weinberg principle}, a basic principle of \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_genetics}{population genetics}.

{\sc G. H. Hardy} is usually known by those outside the field of mathematics for his 1940 essay \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Mathematician%27s_Apology}{\it A Mathematician's Apology}, often considered 1 of the best insights into the mind of a working mathematician written for the layperson\footnote{1. a person who does not have expert knowledge of a particular subject; 2. a person who is a member of a Church but is not a priest or member of the clergy.}.

Starting in 1914, {\sc Hardy} was the mentor of the Indian mathematician \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Srinivasa_Ramanujan}{\sc Srinivasa Ramanujan}, a relationship that has become celebrated. {\sc Hardy} almost immediately recognized {\sc Ramanujan}'s extraordinary albeit untutored brilliance, \& {\sc Hardy \& Ramanujan} became close collaborators. In an interview by \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Erd%C5%91s}{\sc Paul Erd\H{o}s}, when {\sc Hardy} was asked what his greatest contribution to mathematics was, {\sc Hardy} unhesitatingly replied that it was the discovery of {\sc Ramanujan}. In a lecture on {\sc Ramanujan}, {\sc Hardy} said that ``my association with him is the 1 romantic incident in my life''.

\subsubsection{Biography}
{\sc G. H. Hardy} was born on Feb 7, 1877, in \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cranleigh}{Cranleigh}, Surrey, England, into a teaching family. His father was \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bursar}{Bursar} \& Art Master at \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cranleigh_School}{Cranleigh School}; his mother had been a senior mistress at Lincoln Training College for teachers. Both of his parents were mathematically inclined, though neither had a university education. He \& his sister Gertrude ``Gertie'' Emily Hardy (1878--1963) were brought up by their educationally enlightened parents in a typical Victorian nursery attended by a nurse. At an early age, he argued with his nurse about the existence of Santa Clause \& the efficacy of prayer. He read aloud to his sister books e.g., \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Quixote}{\it Don Quixote}, \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulliver%27s_Travels}{\it Gulliver's Travels}, \& \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robinson_Crusoe}{\it Robinson Crusoe}.

{\sc Hardy}'s own natural affinity for mathematics was perceptible at an early age. When just 2 years old, he wrote numbers up to millions, \& when taken to church he amused himself by \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factorize}{factorizing} the numbers of the hymns.

After schooling at \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cranleigh_School}{Cranleigh}, {\sc Hardy} was awarded a scholarship to \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winchester_College}{Winchester College} for his mathematical work. In 1896, he entered \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinity_College,_Cambridge}{Trinity College, Cambridge}. He was 1st tutored under \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Rumsey_Webb}{\sc Robert Rumsey Webb}, but found it unsatisfying, \& briefly considered switching to history. He then was tutored by \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustus_Edward_Hough_Love}{\sc Augustus Love}, who recommended him to read \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camille_Jordan}{\sc Camille Jordan}'s {\it Cours d'analyse}, which taught him for the 1st time ``what mathematics really meant''. After only 2 years of preparation under his coach, \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Alfred_Herman}{\sc Robert Alfred Herman}, {\sc Hardy} was 4th in the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambridge_Mathematical_Tripos}{Mathematics Tripos} examination. Years later, he sought to abolish the Tripos system, as he felt that it was becoming more an end in itself than a means to an end. While at university, {\sc Hardy} joined the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambridge_Apostles}{Cambridge Apostles}, an elite, intellectual secret society.

{\sc Hardy} cited as his most important influence his independent study of {\it Cours d'analyse de l'École Polytechnique} by the French mathematician \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camille_Jordan}{\sc Camille Jordan}, through which he became acquainted with the more precise mathematics tradition in continental Europe. In 1900 he passed part II of the Tripos, \& in the same year he was elected to a Prize Fellowship at Trinity College. In 1903 he earned his M.A., which was the highest academic degree at English universities at that time. When his Prize Fellowship expired in 1906 he was appointed to the Trinity staff as a lecturer in mathematics, where teaching 6 hours per week left him time for research.

On Jan 16, 1913, \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Srinivasa_Ramanujan}{\sc Ramanujan} wrote to {\sc Hardy}, who Ramanujan had known from studying {\it Orders of Infinity} (1910). {\sc Hardy} read the letter in the morning, suspected it was a crank or a prank, but thought it over \& realized in the evening that it was likely genuine because ``great mathematicians are commoner than thieves or humbugs of such incredible skills''. He then invited {\sc Ramanujan} to Cambridge \& began ``the 1 romantic incident in my life''.

In the aftermath of the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bertrand_Russell#First_World_War}{Bertrand Russell affair} during \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I}{World War I}, in 1919 he left Cambridge to take the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savilian_Chair_of_Geometry}{Savilian Chair of Geometry} (\& thus become a Fellow of \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_College,_Oxford}{New College}) at \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxford_University}{Oxford}. {\sc Hardy} spent the academic year 1928--1929 at \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princeton_University}{Princeton University} in an academic exchange with \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oswald_Veblen}{Oswald Veblen}, who spent the year at Oxford. {\sc Hardy} gave the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josiah_Willard_Gibbs_Lectureship}{Josiah Willard Gibbs lecture} for 1928. {\sc Hardy} left Oxford \& returned to Cambridge in 1931, becoming again a fellow of Trinity College \& holding the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sadleirian_Professor_of_Pure_Mathematics}{Sadleirian Professorship} until 1942. It is believed that he left Oxford for Cambridge to avoid the compulsory retirement at 65.

He was on the governing body of \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abingdon_School}{Abingdon School} from 1922--1935.

In 1939, he suffered a \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_thrombosis}{coronary thrombosis}, which prevented him from playing tennis, squash, etc. He also lost his creative powers in mathematics. He was constantly bored \& distracted himself by writing a privately circulated memoir about the {\sc Bertrand Russell} affair. In the early summer of 1947, he attempted suicide by \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbiturate_overdose}{barbiturate overdose}. After that, he resolved to simply wait for death. He died suddenly 1 early morning while listening to his sister read out from a book of the history of Cambridge University cricket.

\subsubsection{Work}
{\sc Hardy} is credited with reforming British mathematics by bringing \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rigour#Mathematical_rigour}{rigor} into it, which was previously a characteristic of French, Swiss, \& German mathematics. British mathematicians had remained largely in the tradition of \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applied_mathematics}{applied mathematics}, in thrall to the reputation of \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton}{\sc Isaac Newton} (see \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambridge_Mathematical_Tripos}{Cambridge Mathematical Tripos}). {\sc Hardy} was more in tune with the {\it cours d'analyse} methods dominant in France, \& aggressively promoted his conception of \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_mathematics}{pure mathematics}, in particular against the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrodynamics}{hydrodynamics} that was an important part of Cambridge mathematics.

{\sc Hardy} preferred to work only 4 hours every day on mathematics, spending the rest of the day talking, playing cricket, \& other gentlemanly activities.

From 1911, he collaborated with \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Edensor_Littlewood}{\sc John Edensor Littlewood}, in extensive work in \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_analysis}{mathematical analysis} \& \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytic_number_theory}{analytic number theory}. This (along with much else) led to quantitative progress on \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waring%27s_problem}{Waring's problem}, as part of the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardy%E2%80%93Littlewood_circle_method}{Hardy--Littlewood circle method}, as it became known. In \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_number}{prime number} theory, they proved results \& some notable \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conditional_result}{conditional results}. This was a major factor in the development of number theory as a system of \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjecture}{conjectuers}; e.g., the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Hardy%E2%80%93Littlewood_conjecture}{1st Hardy--Littlewood conjecture} \& \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Hardy%E2%80%93Littlewood_conjecture}{2nd Hardy--Littlewood conjecture}. {\sc Hardy}'s collaboration with {\sc Littlewood} is among the most successful \& famous collaborations in mathematical history. In a 1947 lecture, the Danish mathematician \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harald_Bohr}{\sc Harald Bohr} reported a colleague as saying, ``Nowadays, there are only 3 really great English mathematicians: {\sc Hardy, Littlewood, \& Hardy--Littlewood}.''

{\sc Hardy} is also known for formulating the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardy%E2%80%93Weinberg_principle}{Hardy--Weinberg principle}, a basic principle of \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_genetics}{population principle}, a basic principle of \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_genetics}{population genetics}, independently from \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilhelm_Weinberg}{\sc Wilhelm Weinberg} in 1908. He played \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket}{cricket} with the geneticist \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reginald_Punnett}{\sc Reginald Punnett}, who introduced the problem to him in purely mathematical terms. {\sc Hardy}, who had no interest in genetics \& described the mathematical argument as ``very simple'', may never have realized how important the result became.

{\sc Hardy} was elected an international honorary member of the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Academy_of_Arts_and_Sciences}{American Academy of Arts \& Sciences} in 1921, an international member of the United States \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Academy_of_Sciences}{National Academy of Sciences} in 1927, \& an international member of the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Philosophical_Society}{American Philosophical Society} in 1939.

{\sc Hardy}'s collected papers have been published in 7 volumes by \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxford_University_Press}{Oxford University Press}.

\paragraph{Pure mathematics.} {\sc Hardy} preferred his work to be considered \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_mathematics}{\it pure mathematics}, perhaps because of his \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacifism}{detestation of war} \& the military uses to which mathematics had been applied. He made several statements similar to that in his \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Mathematician%27s_Apology}{\it Apology}:
\begin{quote}
	``I have never done anything ``useful''. No discovery of mine has made, or is likely to make, directly or indirectly, for good or ill, the least difference to the amenity of the world.''
\end{quote}
However, aside from formulating the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardy%E2%80%93Weinberg_principle}{Hardy--Weinberg principle} in \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_genetics}{population genetics}, his famous work on integer partitions with his collaborator {\sc Ramanujan}, known as the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partition_function_(number_theory)#Approximation_formulas}{Hardy--Ramanujan asymptotic formula}, has been widely applied in physics to find quantum partition functions of atomic nuclei (1st used by \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niels_Bohr}{\sc Niels Bohr}) \& to derive thermodynamic functions of non-interacting \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bose%E2%80%93Einstein_statistics}{Bose--Einstein} systems. Though {\sc Hardy} wanted his maths to be ``pure'' \& devoid\footnote{{\it devoid of something} completely without something.} of any application, much of his work has found applications in other branches of science.

Moreover, {\sc Hardy} deliberately pointed out in his {\it Apology} that mathematicians generally do not ``glory in the uselessness of their work'', but rather -- because science can be used for evil ends as well as good -- ``mathematicians may be justified in rejoicing that there is 1 science at any rate, \& that their own, whose very remoteness from ordinary human activities should keep it gentle \& clean.'' {\sc Hardy} also rejected as a ``delusion'' the belief that the difference between pure \& applied mathematics had anything to do with their utility. {\sc Hardy} regards as ``pure'' the kinds of mathematics that are independent of the physical world, but also considers some ``applied'' mathematicians, e.g. physicists \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Clerk_Maxwell}{\sc Maxwell} \& \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein}{\sc Einstein}, to be among the ``real'' mathematicians, whose work ``has permanent aesthetic value'' \& ``is eternal because the best of it may, like the best literature, continue to cause intense emotional satisfaction to thousands pf people after thousands of years.'' Although he admitted that what he called ``real'' mathematics may someday become useful, he asserted that, at the time in which the {\it Apology} was written, only the ``dull \& elementary parts'' of either pure or applied mathematics could ``work for good or ill''.

\subsubsection{Personality}
{\sc Hardy} was extremely shy as a child \& was socially awkward, cold, \& eccentric\footnote{considered by other people to be strange or unusual.} throughout his life. During his school years, he was top of his class in most subjects, \& won many prizes \& awards but hated having to receive them in front of the entire school. He was uncomfortable being introduced to new people, \& could not bear to look at his own reflection in a mirror. It is said that, when staying in hotels, he would cover all the mirrors with towels.

Socially, {\sc Hardy} was associated with the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomsbury_Group}{Bloomsbury Group} \& the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambridge_Apostles}{Cambridge Apostles}; \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G._E._Moore}{\sc G. E. Moore}, \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bertrand_Russell}{Bertrand Russell} \& \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._M._Keynes}{J. M. Keynes} were friends. Apart from close friendships, he had a few platonic relationships with young men who shared his sensibilities, \& often his love of cricket. A mutual interest in cricket led him to befriend the young \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C._P._Snow}{\sc C. P. Snow}. {\sf Hardy} was a lifelong bachelor \& in his final years he was cared for by his sister.

He was an avid cricket fan. {\sc Maynard Keynes} observed that if {\sc Hardy} had read the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_exchange}{stock exchange} for half an hour every day with as much interest \& attention as he did the day's cricket scores, he would have become a rich man. He liked to speak of the best class of mathematician research as ``the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Hobbs}{Hobbs} class'', \& later, after Bradman appeared as an even greater batsman, ``the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Bradman}{Bradman} class''.

Around the age of 20, he decided that he \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atheism}{did not believe in God}, which proved a minor issue as attending the chapel was compulsory at Cambridge University. He wrote a letter to his parents explaining that, \& from then on he refused to go into any college chapel, even for purely ritualistic duties.

He was at times politically involved, if not an activist. He took part in the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_of_Democratic_Control}{Union of Democratic Control} during World War I, \& for Intellectual Liberty in the late 1930s. He admired America \& Soviet Union roughly equally. He found both sides of the 2nd World War objectionable.

\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Hoffman_(science_writer)}{\sc Paul Hoffman} writes that ``His concerns were wide-ranging, as evidenced by 6 New Year's resolutions he set in a postcard to a friend:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item prove the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemann_hypothesis}{Riemann hypothesis}
	\item make 211 not out in the 4th innings of the last \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Oval}{Test Match at the Oval}
	\item find an argument for the nonexistence of God which shall convince the general public
	\item be the 1st man at the top of \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Everest}{Mount Everest}
	\item be proclaimed the 1st president of the U.S.S.R. of Great Britain \& Germany
	\item murder \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benito_Mussolini}{Mussolini}.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Cultural references}

\textit{Jacques-Louis Lions} ([1] 3 May 1928 - May 17, 2001) was a French mathematician who made contributions to the theory of \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_differential_equation}{partial differential equations} \& to \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_processes}{stochastic control}, among other areas.

He received the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society_for_Industrial_and_Applied_Mathematics}{SIAM}'s \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_von_Neumann_Lecture}{John von Neumann Lecture} prize in 1986 \& numerous other distinctions.[2][3]

Lions is listed as an \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISI_highly_cited_researcher}{ISI highly cited researcher}.[4] 

\subsubsection{Biography}
After being part of the French Résistance in 1943 \& 1944, J.-L. Lions entered the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89cole_Normale_Sup%C3%A9rieure}{École Normale Supérieure} in 1947.

He was a professor of mathematics at the Université of Nancy, the Faculty of Sciences of Paris, \& the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89cole_polytechnique}{École polytechnique}.

%
In 1966 he sent an invitation to \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gury_Marchuk}{Gury Marchuk}, the soviet mathematician to visit Paris.

This was hand delivered by \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_De_Gaulle}{General De Gaulle} during his visit to \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akademgorodok}{Akademgorodok} in June of that year.[5]

%
He joined the prestigious \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coll%C3%A8ge_de_France}{Collège de France} as well as the French Academy of Sciences in 1973.

In 1979, he was appointed director of the Institut National de la Recherche en Informatique et Automatique (\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INRIA}{INRIA}), where he taught \& promoted the use of numerical simulations using finite elements integration.

Throughout his career, Lions insisted on the \textit{use of mathematics in industry}, with a particular involvement in the French space program, as well as in domains such as energy \& the environment.

This eventually led him to be appointed director of the Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales (\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNES}{CNES}) from 1984 to 1992.

%
Lions was elected President of the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Mathematical_Union}{International Mathematical Union} in 1991 \& also received the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan_Prize}{Japan Prize} \& the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvey_Prize}{Harvey Prize} that same year.[3]

In 1992, the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Houston}{University of Houston} awarded him an honorary doctoral degree.

He was elected president of the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Academy_of_Sciences}{French Academy of Sciences} in 1996 \& was also a Foreign Member of the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Society}{Royal Society} (ForMemRS)[6] \& numerous other foreign academies.[2][3]

%
He has left a considerable body of work, among this more than 400 scientific articles, 20 volumes of mathematics that were translated into English \& Russian, \& major contributions to several collective works, including the 4000 pages of the monumental \textit{Mathematical analysis \& numerical methods for science \& technology} (in collaboration with Robert Dautray), as well as the \textit{Handbook of numerical analysis} in 7 volumes (with \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippe_G._Ciarlet}{Philippe G. Ciarlet}).

%
His son \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre-Louis_Lions}{Pierre-Louis Lions} is also a well-known mathematician who was awarded a \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fields_Medal}{Fields Medal} in 1994.[7]

Both father \& son have received honorary doctorates from \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heriot-Watt_University}{Heriot-Watt University} in 1986 \& 1995 respectively.[8]

\subsubsection*{Abstract}
The article is dedicated to recalling the life \& mathematics of Louis Nirenberg, a distinguished Canadian mathematician who recently died in New York, where he lived.

An emblematic figure of analysis \& PDEs in the last century, he was awarded the Abel Prize in 2015.

From this watchtower at the Courant Institute in New York, he was for many years a global teacher \& master.

He was a good friend of Spain.

\end{quotation}

\subsubsection{Introduction}
This article is dedicated to remembering the life \& work of the prestigious Canadian mathematician Louis Nirenberg, born in Hamilton, Ontario, in 1925, who died in New York on Jan 26, 2020, at the age of 94.

Professor for much of his life at the mythical Courant Institute of New York University, he was considered 1 of the best mathematical analysts of the 20th century, a specialist in the analysis of PDEs.

%
When the news of his death was received, it was a very sad moment for many mathematicians, but it was also the opportunity of reviewing an exemplary life \& underlining some of its landmarks.

His work unites diverse fields between what is considered Pure Mathematics \& Applied Mathematics, \& in particular he was cult figure in the discipline of PDEs, a key theory \& tool in the mathematical formulation of many processes in science, in engineering, \& in other branches of mathematics.

\textit{His work is a prodigy of sharpness \& logical perfection, \& at the same time its applications span today multiple scientific areas.}

%
In recognition of his work, in 2015 he received the Abel Prize along with the another great mathematician, John Nash.

The Abel Prize is 1 of the greatest awards in Mathematics, comparable to the Nobel prizes in other sciences.

At that time, the Courant Institute, where he was for so many decades a renowned professor, published an article called \textit{Beautiful Minds}\footnote{\href{https://www.nyu.edu/about/news-publications/news/2015/march/beautiful-minds-courantsnirenberg-princetons-john-nash-win-abel-prize-in-mathematics-.html}{Beautiful Minds: Courant's Nirenberg, Princeton's John Nash Win Abel Prize in Mathematics }.} which is quite enjoyable reading.

%
He was a distinguished member of the AMS (American Mathematical Society).

Throughout his life, he received many other honors \& awards, e.g. the AMS B\^ocher Memorial Prize (1959), the Jeffery-Williams Prize (1987), the Steele Prize for Lifetime Achievement (1994 \& 2014), the National Medal of Science (1995), the inaugural Crafoord Prize from the Royal Swedish Academy (1982), \& the 1st Chern medal at the 2010 International Congress of Mathematicians, awarded by the International Mathematical Union \& the Chern Foundation.

He was a plenary speaker at the International Congress of Mathematicians held in Stockholm in Aug 1962; the title of the conference was \textit{``Some Aspects of Linear \& Nonlinear PDE''}.

In 1969 he was elected Member of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences.

%
It was not honors that concerned him most, but rather his profession \& the mathematical community that surrounded him.

In his long career at the Courant Institute he discovered many mathematical talents \& collaborated in numerous relevant works with distinguished colleagues.

A wise man in science \& life, he was 1 of the most influential \& beloved mathematicians of the last century, \& the current century too.

His teaching extended 1st to the international centers that he loved to visit, \& then to the entire world.

Indeed, we live at this height of time in a world-wide scientific society whose close connection brings so many benefits to the pursuit of knowledge.

Many of his articles are among the most cited in the world.\footnote{Topic 35, PDEs, from the mathematical database Mathscinet, includes 3 articles by L. Nirenberg among the 10 most cited ever.}

\subsubsection{Starting}
In order to start the tour of his mathematics, nothing better than to quote a few paragraphs from the mention of the Abel Prize Committee in 2015:\footnote{\href{https://www.abelprize.no/nyheter/vis.html?tid=63589}{John F. Nash, Jr. \& Louis Nirenberg share the Abel Prize}.}

\textsf{Fig. Louis Nirenberg receiving the Abel Prize from King Harald V of Norway in the presence of John Nash (photo: Berit Roald{\tt/}NTB scanpix).}

\textbf{Mathematical giants:}
\begin{quotation}\it
	Nash \& Nirenberg are 2 mathematical giants of the 20th century.
	
	They are being recognized for their contributions to the field of PDEs, which are equations involving rates of change that originally arose to describe physical phenomena but, as they showed, are also helpful in analyzing abstract geometrical objects.
\end{quotation}
The Abel committee writes:
\begin{quotation}\it
	``Their breakthroughs have developed into versatile \& robust techniques that have become essential tools for the study of nonlinear PDEs.
	
	Their impact can be felt in all branches of the theory.''
\end{quotation}
About Louis they say:
\begin{quotation}\it
	``Nirenberg has had 1 of the longest \& most f\^eted careers in mathematics, having produced important results right up until his 70s.
	
	Unlike Nash, who wrote papers alone, Nirenberg preferred to work in collaboration with others, with more than 90\% of his papers written jointly.
	
	Many results in the world of elliptic PDEs are named after him \& his collaborators, e.g. the Gagliardo--Nirenberg inequalities, the John--Nirenberg inequality \& the Kohn--Nirenberg theory of pseudo-differential operators.''
\end{quotation}
They conclude:
\begin{quotation}\it
	``Far from being confined to the solutions of the problems for which they were devised, the results proven by Nash \& Nirenberg have become very useful tools \& have found tremendous applications in further contexts.''
\end{quotation}
To be precise, Nirenberg made fundamental contributions to both linear \& nonlinear PDEs, functional analysis, \& their application in geometry \& complex analysis.

Among the most famous contributions we will discuss are the Gagliardo-Nirenberg interpolation inequality, which is important in solving the elliptic PDEs that arise within many areas of mathematics; the formalization of the BMO spaces of bounded mean oscillation, \& others that we will be seeing.

%
A work of utmost relevance was the work with Luis Caffarelli \& Robert Kohn aimed at solving the big open problem of existence \& smoothness of the solutions of the Navier-Stokes system of fluid mechanics.

This work was described by the AMS in 2002 as ``1 of the best ever done.''

The problem is on the Millennium Problems List (the list compiled by the Clay Foundation), \& is 1 of the most appealing open problems of mathematical physics, raised nearly 2 centuries ago.

Fermat's Last Theorem \& the Poincar\'e Conjecture have been defeated at the turn of the century, but the Navier-Stokes enigma (and in some sense its companion about the Euler's system) keep defying us.

We will deal with the issue in detail in Section 4.

\paragraph{The beginnings. From Canada to New York.} Louis Nirenberg grew up in Montr\'eal, where his fatehr was a Hebrew teacher.

After graduating\footnote{With a degree in mathematics \& physics, also in mathematics being bilingual counts.} in 1945 at McGill University, Montréal, Louis found a summer job at the National Research Council of Canada, where he met the physicist Ernest Courant, the son of Richard Courant, a famous professor at New York University.

Ernest mentioned to Nirenberg that he was going to New York to see his father \& Louis begged him for advice on a good place to apply for a master study in physics.

He returned with Richard Courant's invitation for Louis to go to New York University (NYU) for a master's degree in mathematics, after which he would be prepared for a physics program.

%
But once Louis began studying Mathematics at NYU, he never changed.

He defended his doctoral thesis under James Stoker in 1949, solving a problem in differential geometry.

The dice were cast.

We reach a crucial moment in Louis's life.

Breaking with the golden rule\footnote{which is an essential part of the American professional practice.} according to which ``a recent doctor should move to a different environment'', Richard Courant kept his best students around him, including Louis Nirenberg, \& he thus created the NYU Mathematical Institute, the famous Courant Institute, which has become a world benchmark for high mathematics, comparable only to the Princeton Institute for Advanced Study on the East Coast of the USA.

Louis was 1st a postdoc \& then a permanent member of the faculty.

There he thrived \& spent his life.

\paragraph{Equations \& Geometry.} The problem Stoker gave to Louis for his thesis, entitled \textit{``The Determination of a Closed Convex Surface Having Given Line Elements''}, is called ``the embedding problem'' or ``Weyl Problem''.

It can be stated as follows: Given a 2D sphere with a Riemannian metric s.t. the Gaussian curvature is positive everywhere, the question is whether a surface can be constructed in 3D space so that the Riemannian distance function coincides with the distance inherited from the usual Euclidean distance in the 3D space (in other words, whether there is an isometric embedding as a convex surface in $\mathbb{R}^3$).

The great German mathematician Hermann Weyl had taken a significant 1st step to solve the problem in 1916, \& Nirenberg, as a student, completed Weyl's construction.

The work to do was to solve a system of nonlinear PDEs of the so-called ``elliptic type''.

It is the kind of equation \& application that Louis Nirenberg has been working on ever since.

Progress has been slow but continued over time \& is impressive at this moment.\footnote{Isometrically embedding low dimensional manifolds into higher dimensional Euclidean spaces is the contents of a famous paper by J. Nash in 1956.}

\subsubsection{The power \& beauty of inequalities}
Focus on 1 of the most relevant topics in Louis Nirenberg's broad legacy, at the same time closest to our mathematical interest.

(Almost) every career in PDEs begin with the study of linear elliptic equations.

These form nowadays a well-established theory which combines Functional Analysis, Calculus of Variations, \& explicit representations to produce solutions in suitable functional spaces.

For the classical equilibrium equations in the mechanics of continuous media, known as Laplace's \& Poisson's equations, in symbols $\Delta u = f$, there is a classical ``maximum principle'' that provides the necessary estimates that guarantee the existence \& uniqueness of solutions.

When combined with skillful tricks of the trade, it makes possible to obtain finer estimates, e.g. regularity \& other properties.

Let us mention the estimates known under the names Harnack \& Schauder, cf. \cite{Evans2010, Gilbarg_Trudinger2001}.

In this regard, Nirenberg is quoted as saying, either jokingly or seriously,
\begin{quotation}\it
	``I made a living off the maximum principle.''\footnote{Curiously, it applies to V\'azquez too.
		
		V\'azquez's most read article deals with the ``Strong Maximum Principle'', [74].}
\end{quotation}
Many of the interesting problems that are proposed in Physics \& other sciences \& involve PDEs are \textbf{nonlinear}, e.g. the fluid equations or the curvature problems in geometry.

These nonlinear problems can seldom be solved by explicit formulas.

Because of that difficulty, the mathematical study of these problems has attracted increasing attention from the best mathematical minds of the past century, with remarkable success stories.

The usual approach goes as follows: the solution has to be obtained by some kind of approximation, \& an essential technical point is usually to show that the proposed approximation procedure (or procedures) converge to a solution\footnote{Taken in some sense acceptable to physics, e.g., the solution in the weak sense or the solution in the distributional sense.}.

A complicated topology \& functional analysis machinery has been developed over time \& is available to test such convergence, provided certain estimates are fulfilled; their role is to allow for the approximation to be controlled.

See in this sense the book that many of us have studied as young people \cite{Brezis2011}.

%
Much of the work of an ``EDP Analyst''\footnote{\textit{Analysis of PDEs} is an area of Mathematics in the US that perfectly describes our specialty which is neither pure nor applied, \& does not need to declare itself in either direction.
	
	Such a denomination is not much used in Spain \& other countries; i.e., in V\'azquez's opinion, the source of some persistent malfunctions.} consists in finding estimates that control the passage to the limit that has to be applied, or to find a convenient fixed point theorem.

A common saying in our trade goes as follows: \textit{Existence theorems come from a priori estimates \& suitable functional analysis}.

Estimate, this is the key word in the world that Louis Nirenberg \& his colleagues bequeathed us.

``Estimate'' means the same thing as ``inequality'', \& here V\'azquez refers of course to a functional or numerical inequality.

%
It may look surprising to the reader, even weird, to find it so clearly stated: Inequalities, \& not equalities (or identities), are the technical core of such a central theory of mathematics as PDEs.

However, this is precisely the mathematical revolution that was in the making when Louis was young.

Indeed, when he arrived at NYU, the most active \& renowned researcher was probably Kurt Otto Friedrichs, who decisively influenced Nirenberg's future research career.

Friedrichs loved inequalities, as Louis put it:
\begin{quotation}\it
	``Friedrichs was a great lover of inequalities \& that affected me very much.
	
	The point of view was that the inequalities are more interesting than the equalities.''
\end{quotation}
Carrying forward on that idea, Nirenberg has been unanimously recognized as a world master of inequalities''.

Here is another saying by Louis:
\begin{quotation}\it
	``I love inequalities.
	
	So if somebody shows me a new inequality, I say: ``Oh, that's beautiful, let me think about it,'' \& I may have some ideas connected to it.''
\end{quotation}
For many years, mathematicians from all over the world came to the Courant Institute to seek his advice on issues involving inequalities.

%
And there we are.

We do not reject or despise the beauty of the exact solution if there is one, but functional inequalities are our firm support in an uncertain world that is yet to be discovered \& described.

The key technical point of modern PDE theory is to establish the most needed \& appropriate estimates in the strongest possible way.

\paragraph{Sobolev, Gagliardo \& Nirenberg.} There are many types of estimates the researcher needs in the study of nonlinear PDEs, but some have turned out to be much more relevant than others.

V\'azquez will talk here about a type that has become particularly famous \& useful.

They are often collectively called ``Sobolev estimates'' in honor of the great Russian mathematician Sergei Lvovich Sobolev because of his seminal work [68], 1938.

Briefly stated, they estimate the norms of functions belonging to the Lebesgue spaces $L^p(\Omega)$, $1\le p\le\infty$, in terms of their (weak) derivatives of various orders.

In 1959 Emilio Gagliardo [35] \& Louis Nirenberg [59] gave an independent \& very simple proof of the following inequality:

\textsf{Fig. The Talenti profile for different values of the parameters.}

\begin{theorem}[Gagliardo-Nirenberg-Sobolev Inequality]
	Let $1\le p < n$. There exists a constant $C > 0$ s.t. the following inequality
	\begin{align*}
		\|u\|_{L^{p^*}(\mathbb{R}^n)}\le C\|Du\|_{L^p(\mathbb{R}^n)},\ p^*\coloneqq\frac{np}{n - p},
	\end{align*}
	holds true for all functions $u\in C_c^1(\mathbb{R}^n)$. The constant $C$ depends only on $p$ \& $n$. The exponent $p^*$ is called the \emph{Sobolev conjugate} of $p$. $Du$ denotes the gradient vector.
\end{theorem}
Gagliardo \& Nirenberg included as their starting point the important case of exponent $p = 1$, left out by Sobolev.

The inequality implies the continuous inclusion of the Banach space called $W^{1,p}(\mathbb{R}^n)$ into $L^{p^*}(\mathbb{R}^n)$ (immersion theorem).

Versions for functions defined in bounded open sets $\mathbb{R}^n$ followed naturally.

This inequality soon attracted multiple applications \& a wide array of variants \& improvements.

Very interesting versions deal with functions defined on Riemannian manifolds.

V\'azquez comments below 4 additional aspects that he finds appropriate for the curious reader.
\begin{itemize}
	\item[(i)] Thierry Aubin [3] \& Giorgio Talenti [72] obtained in 1976 the \textit{best constant} in this inequality, finding the functions that exhibit the \textit{worst behavior}\footnote{This is an apparent grammatical contradiction that gives rise to beautiful functions.}
	
	Indeed, when $1 < p < n$ the maximum quotient $\frac{\|u\|_{L^{p^*}(\mathbb{R}^n)}}{\|Du\|_{L^p(\mathbb{R}^n)}}$ is optimally realized by the function
	\begin{align*}
		U({\bf x}) = \left(a + b|{\bf x}|^{\frac{p}{p - 1}}\right)^{-\frac{n - p}{p}},
	\end{align*}
	where $a,b > 0$ are arbitrary constants.\footnote{Consider the simple case $a = b = 1$, $p = 2$ in dimension $n = 4$.
		
		The function looks a bit like Gaussian but it is not at all.}
	
	It is the famous \textit{Talenti profile}.
	
	Note that $\frac{n - p}{p} = \frac{n}{p^*}$.
	
	It happens that $U$ is a probability density (integrable) if $\frac{n - p}{p - 1} > n$, i.e., if $1 < p < p_c = \frac{2n}{n + 1}$.
	
	The $U$ profile \& its power appear recurrently in PDEs.
	
	Thus, in nonlinear diffusion we find it as a power of the Barenblatt profile in fast diffusion, see Chap. 11 of [75], \& the curiously critical exponent $p_c$ also appears, but with consequences that go in the converse direction.
	\item Gagliardo \& Nirenberg's work extends to the famous \textit{Gagliardo-Nirenberg interpolation inequality}, a result in Sobolev's theory of spaces that estimates a certain norm of a function in terms of a product of norms of functions \& derivatives thereof.
	
	We enter here a realm of higher complexity.\footnote{V\'azquez will avoid further details on these inequalities that can be found in the cited references.}
	
	See details in [10].
	\item[(iii)] In 1984 Luis Caffarelli, Bob Kohn \& Louis Nirenberg needed inequalities of the previous type in functional Lebesgue spaces but with the novelty of including so-called \textit{weights}, \& this motivated the article [18], on the famous \textit{CKN estimates originated} for spaces with power weights.
	
	This was the beginning of an extensive literature.
	
	A very striking effect arose in those studies: unlike GNS inequalities, there exists a phenomenon of symmetry breaking in the CKN inequalities, i.e., minimizers of such inequalities need not be symmetric functions, even when posed in the whole space or in balls.
	
	The exact range of parameters for the symmetry breaking was found by J. Dolbeault, M. J. Esteban \& M. Loss in [29].
	\item[(iv)] In 2004 D. Cordero-Erausquin, B. Nazareth \& C. Villani [24] used mass transport methods to obtain sharp versions of the Sobolev-Gagliardo-Nirenberg inequalities.
	
	Mass transport is 1 of the most powerful new instruments used in PDE research.
	
	This topic is related to the isoperimetric inequalities of ancient fame.\footnote{See \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isoperimetric-inequality}{Wikipedia{\tt/}Isoperimetric Inequality}.} that now live moments of fruitful coincidence with Sobolev theory.
	
	The survey [15] talks about this relationship.
\end{itemize}
The world of estimates that we have outlined has came to be an enormous space presided over by quite distinguished names, like H. Poincar\'e, J. Nash, G. H. Hardy, C. Morrey, J. Moser, N. Trudinger \& other remarkable figures.

Hardy-Littlewood-P\'olya's book [41] had a great influence on generations of analysts.

A commendable book on the importance of inequalities in Physics is the 2nd volume of Elliott Lieb's selected works, [53].

%
As a representative example chosen from among the numerous recent works, V\'azquez mentions the arcile by M. del Pino \& Jean Dolbeault [25].

It establishes a new optimal version of the Euclidean Gagliardo-Nirenberg inequalities.

This allows the authors to obtain the convergence rates to the equilibrium profiles of some nonlinear diffusion equations, e.g. those of the ``porous media'' type, 1 of the leitmotifs of V\'azquez's research.

The authors completed the study \& application with 2 new articles in 2003.

New functional inequalities based on entropy, maximum principles, \& symmetrization processes allowed a group of V\'azquez to find convergence rates for very fast diffusion equations in [7], thus solving in 2009 a much studied open problem.

It was almost 3 years of work by a team of 5 people.

Plus the work of previous authors.

%
Finally, there is a great deal of activity in the world of Sobolev spaces of fractional order (also called \textit{Slobodeckii spaces}), \& the associated fractional diffusions, cf. [21, 27].

It is a topic in full swing, a part of V\'azquez's current mathematical efforts.\footnote{There is a wide representation of Spanish mathematicians active in these subjects with remarkable results that would be well worth a review.}

\paragraph{New Spaces. John-Nirenberg space.} Go back for a moment to the origins.

The limiting case of the Gagliardo-Nirenberg-Sobolev inequality happens for $p = n$.

Thanks to new inequalities due to C. Morrey, we know that for $p > n$ the resulting functions are H\"older continuous functions, \cite{Evans2010}.

But the $p = n$ case was bizarre \& it was left to Fritz John \& Louis Nirenberg to solve the puzzle in 1961 by introducing the new BMO space of functions of \textit{bounded mean oscillation}, see [44].

Actually, BMO is not a function space but rather a space of function classes modulo constants.

For this space there is the appropriate inequality.

\begin{theorem}[John-Nirenberg]
	If $u\in W^{1,n}(\mathbb{R}^n)$ then $u$ belongs to $BMO$ and
	\begin{align*}
		\|u\|_{BMO}\le C\|Du\|_{L^n(\mathbb{R}^n)},
	\end{align*}
	for a constant $C > 0$ depending only on $n$.\footnote{The curious reader will wonder which function optimizes the constant. So?}
\end{theorem}
The BMO spaces are once a very popular new object in functional \& harmonic analysis, they replace $L^\infty$ when it turns out so.

They were characterized by Charles Fefferman in [32].

The BMO spaces are slightly larger than $L^\infty$.

The possible inequality (and functional immersion) of John-Nirenberg type using $L^\infty$ instead of BMO as image space may seem reasonable but it is false.\footnote{Find an elementary counterexample.}

We ought to be very careful then with the critical cases, that Louis treated with utmost attention.

The John-Nirenberg spaces are used in analysis, in PDEs, in stochastic processes, \& in multiple applications.

The reader may use the references [49] \& [8] for some updates to recent work.

\subsubsection{Navier-Stokes Equations}
The Navier-Stokes system of equations describes the dynamics of an incompressible viscous fluid.

It was proposed in the 19th century to correct Euler's equations of ideal fluids, \& adapt them to the more realistic viscous real world, [4].

The system reads \textbf{(1)}
\begin{equation*}
	\left\{\begin{split}
		\partial_t{\bf u} + ({\bf u}\cdot\nabla){\bf u} + \frac{1}{\rho}\nabla p &= \nu\Delta{\bf u} + \frac{1}{\rho}{\bf f},\\
		\nabla\cdot{\bf u} = 0,
	\end{split}\right.
\end{equation*}
where ${\bf u}$ is the \textit{velocity vector}, $p$ is the \textit{pressure}, both variable, while $\rho$ (the \textit{density}) \& $\nu$ (the \textit{viscosity}) can be taken as positive constants.

It has had a spectacular success in practical science \& engineering, but its essential mathematical aspects (existence, uniqueness, \& regularity) have offered a stubborn resistance in the physical case of 3 space dimensions (3 or $> 3$ for the mathematician).

\textsf{Nirenberg on the blackboard (photo: Courant Institute, NYU).}

%
Fundamental works to cast the theory in a modern functional framework are due to Jean Leray [50, 51], who already in 1934 speaks of weak derivatives in spaces of integrable functions.

Using the new methods of functional analysis, authors soon obtained estimates that proved to be good enough to establish the existence \& uniqueness of Leray solutions in 2 space dimensions, $n = 2$.

Furthermore, for regular initial data the solution is classical.

But the advance stopped sharply in higher dimensions, $n\ge 3$.

V\'azquez gives the word to Charles Fefferman, of Princeton University, in his description of the open problem as the Clay Foundation Millennium Problem.

It is about proving or refuting the following Conjecture:
\begin{quotation}\it
	(A) Existence \& smoothness of Navier-Stokes solutions on $\mathbb{R}^3$.
	
	Take viscosity $\nu > 0$ \& $n = 3$.
	
	Let ${\bf u}_0({\bf x})$ be any smooth, divergence-free vector field satisfying the regularity \& decay conditions (\emph{specified}).
	
	Take external force $f(t,{\bf x})$ to be identically zero.
	
	Then there exists smooth functions $p(t,{\bf x})$, $u_i(t,{\bf x})$ on $[0,\infty)\times\mathbb{R}^3$ that satisfy the Navier-Stokes system with initial conditions in the whole space.\footnote{See full details of the presentation in \url{https://www.claymath.org/sites/default/files/navierstokes.pdf}.}
\end{quotation}
The most significant advance in this field is in V\'azquez's opinion the article [17] in which L. Caffarelli, R. Kohn \& L. Nirenberg attached the problem of regularity \& showed that if a solution with classical data develops singularities in a finite time, the set of such singularities must be in any case quite small in size.

More specifically, ``the 1D measure, in the Hausdorff sense, of the set of possible singularities (located in space-time) is zero.''

This implies that if the singular set is not empty, it cannot contain any line or filament.

In 1998 F. H. Lin [54] gave an interesting new proof of this result.

%
V\'azquez is talking about 1 of the milestones of the authors' career; it happened during the stay of a young Luis Caffarelli at the Courant Institute at Louis's invitation, \& was published in 1982.

The topic Fluids is completely different from the previous sections, but the functional estimates in Sobolev spaces play an essential role, along with the machinery of geometric measure theory.

%
The possible presence of these singularities was conjectured by Leray as a possible explanation for the phenomenon of \textit{turbulence}.

According to this hypothesis, even for regular data, solutions in 3 or more dimensions can develop singularities in finite time in the form of points where the so-called \textit{vorticity} becomes infinite.

%
In the elapsed time, it has not been possible to prove or refute Conjecture (A).

Many efforts have been invested \& V\'azquez believes that will bear fruit 1 day.

An account of the state of affairs in the Euler \& NSEs around 2008 is due to P. Constantin [23].

At the present moment V\'azquez is entertained by a number of trials \& false proofs (some of them quite well published).

There are excellent general texts on Navier-Stokes, e.g. [36] \& [73].

2 very recent texts are [66] \& [67].

\subsubsection{Elliptic Equations \& the Calculus of Variations}
For reasons of selection \& space, V\'azquez will be quite brief on a subject in which Louis made so many contributions.

V\'azquez mentions 1st of all the article [11] by Haim Brezis \& Louis Nirenberg, which figures among the most widely read among the works of both authors.

It deals with the existence of solutions of semilinear elliptic equations with critical exponent (once again!)
\begin{align*}
	\Delta u + f({\bf x},u) + u^{\frac{n + 2}{n - 2}} = 0.
\end{align*}
2 further articles that had great impact are work in collaboration with Shmuel Agmon \& Avron Douglis [1], year 1959, \& [2], year 1964.

They are near-the-boundary estimates for solutions of elliptic equations that satisfy general boundary conditions.

Behavior near the boundary of nonlinear or degenerate PDE solutions, or in domains with nonsmooth boundaries, is a really delicate issue.

Indeed, it is a topic of permanent interest in our community, in theory \& also because of its practical interest\footnote{Think about the behavior of fluids in domains with corners.}.

%
The article [6]with Henri Berestycki \& S. R. S. Varadhan links the study of the 1st eigenvalue with the maximum principle, a subject that Louis enjoyed so much.

In this context V\'azquez finds the famous article on the method of the ``moving planes'' of 1991 [5] in collaboration with Henri Berestycki, which V\'azquez consider a gem.

%
In the Calculus of Variations, V\'azquez quotes the article [11] with Haim Brezis, about the difference between local minimizers in the spaces $H^1$ \& $C^1$. See also [12].

%
A topic of great interest for Louis was the study of geometric properties e.g. symmetry.

The articles [37, 38] with Vasilis Gidas \& Wei-Ming Ni deal with the radial symmetry of certain positive solutions of nonlinear elliptic equations that is imposed by the equation \& the shape of the domain.

\subsubsection{Other contributions}
V\'azquez collects here brief comments on important results obtained by Louis \& his collaborators on various topics that would deserve a more extensive treatment.

\paragraph{Operator theory.} Nirenberg \& Joseph J. Kohn\footnote{J. J. Kohn is a brilliant Princeton analyst, not to be confused with R. Kohn from Courant.
	
	J. J. Kohn speaks perfect Spanish with an Ecuadorian accent.} introduced of a \textit{pseudo-differential operator} that helped generate a huge amount of later work in the brilliant school of harmonic analysis.

In a 1965 article, [48], they dealt with pseudo-differential operators with a complete \& algebraic view.

The operators in question act on the space of tempered distributions at $\mathbb{R}^n$, \& are estimated in terms of Fourier transform norms.

The importance of these results is that they take into account all the ``lower order terms'', difficult to deal with in previous articles.

See also the volume [61] edited by Louis.

\paragraph{Free boundary problems.} This is 1 of the favorite topics of this reviewer.

In 1977 Louis published with David Kinderlehrer the article [45] on the regularity of free boundary problems for elliptic equations, at the beginning of an era that was to witness great progress.

To put it clearly, let us assume that $u$ is a solution to the problem
\begin{align*}
	\Delta u\le f,\ u\ge 0,\ (\Delta u - f)u = 0,
\end{align*}
defined in a domain $D\subset\mathbb{R}^n$.

Boundary data are also given at the fixed boundary $\partial D$.

These data are intended to determine not only $u$ but also the positivity domain $\Omega = \{{\bf x}\in D;u({\bf x}) > 0\}$, or still better the boundary of $\Omega$ that lies within $D$, called the \textit{free boundary}:
\begin{align*}
	\Gamma(u) = \partial\Omega\cap D.
\end{align*}
This is properly called an \textit{obstacle problem}.

To get a physical idea, we can imagine a membrane in space $\mathbb{R}^3$ of height $z = U(x,y)$ that is subject to boundary conditions $U = h\ge 0$ in $\partial D$ \& must lie above a stable (obstacle) of height $U_{\rm obst}(x,y) = 0$.

\textsf{Fig. Free boundaries \& obstacles (pictures: X. Ros-Oton).}

%
Often, we want to consider a nontrivial obstacle $\varphi$, usually a concave function as in the figure.

This leads to an interesting equivalent formulation.

If we put $u = U + \varphi$, we arrive at the problem
\begin{align*}
	\Delta u\le g,\ u\ge\varphi,\ (\Delta u - g)(U - \varphi) = 0,
\end{align*}
with \textit{driving term} $g = f + \Delta\varphi$, \& then we usually take $g = 0$.

In this formulation, $u$ is constrained to stay above the obstacle $u_{\rm obst}({\bf x}) = var\phi$.

%
In any case, in the ``free part'', $\{{\bf x}\in\mathbb{R}^n;U({\bf x}) > 0\} = \{{\bf x}\in\mathbb{R}^n;u({\bf x}) > \varphi\}$, an elastic equation $\Delta U = f$ is satisfied, but a priori we do not know where that part could be located.

It is therefore a problem that combines PDEs \& Geometry (again!).

%
This problem was known to have a unique \textit{solution pair}, $(u,\Gamma)$.

The attentive reader will have observed that once $\Gamma$ is known, \& with it $\Omega$, the PDE problem to find $u$ is rather elementary.

Therefore, the difficulty lies in principle in the geometry.

However, the solution to the puzzle was rather found in nonlinear analysis, [47], which also produces efficient numerical methods.

%
We then encounter a big theoretical problem: determining how regular is the set $\Gamma$, that we have found by abstract methods, \& also determining how regular is $u$ near $\Gamma$.

Even the simplest question: ``is $\Gamma$ a surface?'' has to be answered.

D. Kinderlehrer \& L. Nirenberg gave local conditions on $f$ \& assumed a certain initial regularity of $u$ to conclude that then $\Gamma$ is a very regular, even analytical, hyper-surface.

The study of free boundaries extends to problems evolving in time, e.g. the very famous Stefan problem discussed by Louis in [46].

The 1980s were years of great progress in the mathematical understanding of free boundaries, with reference books e.g. [28, 34].

%
This is a field of very intense activity, both theoretical \& applied, in which V\'azquez has worked with great delight for decades.

A required reference for in-depth study of the regularity of the free boundaries is the book [20] by L. Caffarelli \& S. Salsa, see also A. Petrosyan et al. [64].

A study of tumor growth modeling, seen as a free boundary problem, was done by B. Perthame et al. in [63], it is just an example from a vast literature.

\paragraph{Geometric Equations.} The article [55] with Charles Loewner in 1974 deals with PDEs that are invariant under conformal or projective transformations.

The reader will recall in this context the current relevance of PDEs linked to problems of Riemannian geometry, e.g. the Yamabe problem.

V\'azquez refers to the lengthy overview [52] due to Yan Yan Li, Louis's doctoral student that has been for many years professor at Rutgers.

\paragraph{Complex geometry.} The topic interested Louis a lot in his beginnings.

A Newlander \& L. Nirenberg wrote in 1965 an article published in Annals of Mathematics [56] on analytical coordinates in quasi-complex manifolds.

The Newlander-Nirenberg Theorem states that any integrable quasi-complex structure is induced by a complex structure.

Integrability is expressed through a list of differential conditions.

%
V\'azquez puts an end here to the mathematical journey, unfortunately unfair in many aspects due to the brevity of space \& his ignorance in so many subjects.

V\'azquez hopes that the extensive cited literature will serve as an indication of the profound influence of Louis Nirenberg \& his world on the mathematicians \& mathematics that have followed him.

For the curious reader, there are excellent articles dealing with the work \& life of Louis Nirenberg: a congress in his honor on the occasion of the 75th anniversary was organized by Alice Chang et al. \& is collected in [22].

He was interviewed by Allyn Jackson for the \textit{AMS Notices} in 2002, [43], \& Simon Donaldson, Fields Medal, wrote about him in the same journal in 2011, [30].

Yan-Yan Li's [52] 2010 article focuses on the analysis of geometric problems.

On the occasion of the Abel Prize, Xavier Cabré wrote a review in Catalan in [14] \& Tristan Rivi\`ere reviews his work in PDEs in [65].

A mathematical description of the influence of his ideas appeared in 2016 in [69] with contributions of a number of experts: X. Cabr\'e (symmetries of solutions), A. Chang (Gauss curvature problem), G. Seregin (Navier-Stokes problem), E. Carlen \& A. Figalli (stability of the GNS inequality), M. T. Wang \& S. T. Yau (Weyl problem \& general relativity).

Finally, the book [42] presents the laureates of the Abel Prize in the period 2013--2017.

In it Robert V. Kohn devotes to L. Nirenberg the article \textit{``A few of Louis Nirenberg's many contributions to the theory of PDEs''}.

By the way, there is a beautiful quotation from Abel as motto for the book:
\begin{quotation}
	``Au reste il me para\^{\i}t que si l'on veut faire des progr\`es dans les math\'ematiques il faut \'etudier les maîtres et non pas les \'ecoliers.''\footnote{In English: \textit{``Finally, it appears to me that if one wants to make progress in mathematics, one should study the masters, not the students.''} Taken from the book.}
\end{quotation}
\textbf{Update.} the article \textit{``A personal tribute to Louis Nirenberg''}, posted by Prof. Joel Spruck in the Arxiv repository in May 2021, [70].

As a person who met Louis Nirenberg in 1972 \& became a Courant Instructor, his detailed report on a selection of Louis's works is a very commendable reading.

He concentrates on the work inspired by geometric problems beginning around 1974, especially the method of moving planes, \& implicit fully nonlinear elliptic equations, \& makes comments on Louis' personality.

\subsubsection{The quiet wise man \& Spain}
V\'azquez's 1st memory of Louis Nirenberg sets them in Lisbon in the spring of 1982.\footnote{At the International Symposium in Homage to Prof. J. Sebati\~ao e Silva.}

Louis was already famous \& V\'azquez was a novice in the art.

In Lisbon V\'azquez listened to 1 of his talks, which brought together the depth of the mathematics, the simplicity of the exposition \& a grace to add some comment as timely as it was nice, characteristic features of Louis that delighted the public.

%
In the fall of that same year V\'azquez set foot in the US, headed for the University of Minnesota,\footnote{This American university was very popular with young Spanish graduates \& doctors for the excellence of its studies in Mathematics \& Economics.} to work on free boundary problems with Don Aronson \& with Luis Caffarelli, who was back from his visit to Courant Institute.

Then V\'azquez saw, through the group of great professor V\'azquez had access to, that mathematical research offered a much better way of life.

Among that group of friends V\'azquez counts Haim Brezis \& Luis Caffarelli who have been V\'azquez's masters, Louis Nirenberg, Constantine Dafermos, Donald Aronson, Mike Crandall, Hans Weinberger,$\ldots$ V\'azquez will never cease from thanking them for that vision.

%
A few years later, V\'azquez had the honor of participating in the organization of a summer course at the UIMP\footnote{Men\'endez Pelayo International University, the course took place in 1987 at the Palacio de la Magdalena in Santander.} which included Louis as lecturer along with Don G. Aronson (Minnesota), Philippe Bénilan (Besançon), Luis A. Caffarelli (IAS Princeton) \& Constantine Dafermos (Brown Univ.).

These courses were inspired by Luis Caffarelli, close collaborator \& friend of Louis, with the support of the Rector of the UIMP, Prof. Ernest Lluch,\footnote{Scholar of indelible memory, great protector of science \& great conversationalist, he died tragically for being a good person at a very turbulent time.} \& somehow they transmitted a certain spirit of mathematics that was being done around the Courant Institute.

The course had a remarkable consequence.

A young mathematician from Barcelona, Xavier Cabr\'e, a student in the course, went to the Courant Institute with Louis Nirenberg \& thus began an international mathematical career, like the ones that so many young people crave today.

His thesis, directed by Louis, dealt with ``Estimates for Solutions of Elliptic \& Parabolic Equations'' (NYU, 1994).

Following his stay in New York, he published with Luis Caffarelli the beautiful book [16] on the so-called \textit{completely nonlinear elliptic equations}.

Xavier Cabr\'e is now an ICREA Professor at the UPC in Barcelona.

Louis Nirenberg visited Spain several times, specially Barcelona, \& had many Spanish friends \& admirers.

%
Although V\'azquez did not become a collaborator of Louis, V\'azquez had the opportunity of seeing him \& talking to him on several occasions.

V\'azquez highlights a stay at the Courant Institute in the winter of 1996 where V\'azquez could appreciate the day-to-day life of the ``quiet wise man'', or a congress in Argentina in 2009 when Louis was already very senior but loved life as the 1st day.

The last event in which V\'azquez saw him took place at Columbia University, New York, in May of last year (2019), in a congress in honor of Luis Caffarelli.

He went to some talks in his wheelchair at 94 years old, and, with his proverbial good humor he told them that it was a bit difficult for him to follow the lectures!

%
Impressed by his personality, the young mathematician David Fern\'andez \& V\'azquez wrote a portrait of him in 2 entries in the blog \textit{``The Republic of Mathematics''} that they edit in ``Investigaci\'on y Ciencia'' (Spanish partner of ``Sciencific American'').

They called the essays ``Louis Nirenberg, the quiet wise man'' (I) \& (II).\footnote{\url{https://www.investigacionyciencia.es/blogs/matematicas/75/posts}.}

He was a teacher \& master of science as those described by George Steiner in [71], where the relationship between teacher \& pupil, master \& disciple, is what matters.

Louis had 46 doctoral students, many of them well-known mathematicians.\footnote{The 1st was Walter Littman (in 1956), whom V\'azquez treated so much in Minnesota.}

It was not his style to write long textbooks, he was the author of [60] \& the recently published [62].

%
We will miss the teacher, master \& senior friend who always looked gentle \& kind, who loved Italy (\textit{il bel paese}), culture, good food \& talking about movies \& friends, \& with whom mathematics was easy \& exciting.

Nirenberg lived in New York since 1949, in the Upper West Side, he was a perfect New Yorker \& at the same time a citizen of the wide world.

He worked until the end of his life, frequently visiting ``his'' Institute.

Lucky soul, how V\'azquez envies him, now \& here the ``elders'' seem expendable for public utility.

%
V\'azquez is proud to bear his name Louis $=$ Luis, like Luis Caffarelli or Jacques Louis Lions or Luigi Ambrosio.

He is already a great name in mathematics \& it is an honor that carries the burden of working as Louis Nirenberg, only for the best \& always in a good mood, \& that is not easy.

Rest in eternal peace, beloved Master.

In the Elysian fields you will have time to think about new functional inequalities, the beautiful functions that optimize them, \& their surprising fruits.

In our own small way, we also follow them, as in [26].\hfill$\square$

\textit{Laurent-Moïse Schwartz} (Mar 5, 1915 - Jul 4, 2002) was a French mathematician.

He pioneered the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory}{theory} of \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distribution_(mathematics)}{distributions}, which gives a well-defined meaning to objects such as the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirac_delta_function}{Dirac delta function}.

He was awarded the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fields_Medal}{Fields Medal} in 1950 for his work on the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distribution_(mathematics)}{theory of distributions}.

For several years he taught at the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89cole_polytechnique}{École polytechnique}.

\subsubsection{Biography}

\paragraph{Family}
Laurent Schwartz came from a Jewish family of \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alsace}{Alsatian} origin, with a strong scientific background: his father was a well-known \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgeon}{surgeon}, his uncle \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Debr%C3%A9}{Robert Debré} (who contributed to the creation of \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNICEF}{UNICEF}) was a famous \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics}{pediatrician}, \& his great-uncle-in-law, \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques_Hadamard}{Jacques Hadamard}, was a famous mathematician.

%
During his training at \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyc%C3%A9e_Louis-le-Grand}{Lycée Louis-le-Grand} to enter the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89cole_Normale_Sup%C3%A9rieure}{École Normale Supérieure}, he fell in love with \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marie-H%C3%A9l%C3%A8ne_Schwartz}{Marie-Hélène Lévy}, daughter of the probabilist \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_L%C3%A9vy_(mathematician)}{Paul Lévy} who was then teaching at the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89cole_polytechnique}{École polytechnique}.

Later they would have 2 children, Marc-André \& Claudine.

Marie-Hélène was gifted in mathematics as well, as she contributed to the geometry of singular analytic spaces \& taught at the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universit%C3%A9_Lille_Nord_de_France}{University of Lille}.

%
Angelo Guerraggio describes ``Mathematics, politics \& butterflies'' as his ``3 great loves''.[1]

\paragraph{Education}
According to his teachers, Schwartz was an exceptional student.

He was particularly gifted in Latin, Greek \& mathematics.

1 of his teachers told his parents: ``\textit{Beware, some will say your son has a gift for languages, but he is only interested in the scientific \& mathematical aspect of languages: he should become a mathematician}.''

%
In 1934, he was admitted at the École Normale Supérieure, \& in 1937 he obtained the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agr%C3%A9gation}{agrégation} (with rank 2).

\paragraph{World War II}
As a man of \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trotskyism}{Trotskyist} affinities \& \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jew}{Jewish} descent, life was difficult for Schwartz during \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II}{World War II}.

He had to hide \& change his identity to avoid being \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deportation}{deported} after Nazi Germany overran France.

He worked for the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Strasbourg}{University of Strasbourg} (which had been relocated in \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clermont-Ferrand}{Clermont-Ferrand} because of the war) under the name of Laurent-Marie Sélimartin, while Marie-Hélène used the name Lengé instead of Lévy.

Unlike other mathematicians at Clermont-Ferrand such as \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques_Feldbau}{Feldbau}, the couple managed to escape the Nazis.

\paragraph{Later career}
Schwartz taught mainly at \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89cole_Polytechnique}{École Polytechnique}, from 1958 to 1980.

At the end of the war, he spent one year in \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grenoble}{Grenoble} (1944), then in 1945 joined the University of \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nancy,_France}{Nancy} on the advice of \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Delsarte}{Jean Delsarte} \& \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Dieudonn%C3%A9}{Jean Dieudonné}, where he spent 7 years.

He was both an influential researcher \& teacher, with students such as \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernard_Malgrange}{Bernard Malgrange}, \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques-Louis_Lions}{Jacques-Louis Lions}, \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fran%C3%A7ois_Bruhat}{François Bruhat} \& \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Grothendieck}{Alexander Grothendieck}.

He joined the science faculty of the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Paris}{University of Paris} in 1952.

In 1958 he became a teacher at the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89cole_polytechnique}{École polytechnique} after having at 1st refused this position.

From 1961 to 1963 the École polytechnique suspended his right to teach, because of his having signed the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifesto_of_the_121}{Manifesto of the 121} about the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algerian_war}{Algerian war}, a gesture not appreciated by Polytechnique's military administration.

However, Schwartz had a lasting influence on mathematics at the École polytechnique, having reorganized both teaching \& research there.

In 1965 he established the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centre_de_math%C3%A9matiques_Laurent-Schwartz}{Centre de mathématiques Laurent-Schwartz} (CMLS) as its 1st director.

%
In 1973 he was elected corresponding member of the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Academy_of_Sciences}{French Academy of Sciences}, \& was promoted to full membership in 1975.

\subsubsection{Mathematical legacy}
In 1950 at the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Congress_of_Mathematicians}{International Congress of Mathematicians}, Schwartz was a plenary speaker[Schwartz, Laurent (1950). ``\textit{Théorie des noyaux}'' (PDF). In: Proceedings of the International Congress of Mathematicians, Cambridge, Massachusetts, U.S.A., Aug 30--Sep 6, 1950. vol. 1. pp. 220--230.] \& was awarded the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fields_Medal}{Fields Medal} for his work on \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distribution_(mathematics)}{distributions}.

He was the 1st French mathematician to receive the Fields medal.

Because of his sympathy for \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trotskyism}{Trotskyism}, Schwartz encountered serious problems trying to enter the United States to receive the medal; however, he was ultimately successful.

%
The theory of distributions clarified the (then) mysteries of the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirac_delta_function}{Dirac delta function} \& \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heaviside_step_function}{Heaviside step function}.

It helps to extend the theory of \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_transform}{Fourier transforms} \& is now of critical importance to the theory of \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_differential_equation}{partial differential equations}.

\subsubsection{Popular science}
Throughout his life, Schwartz actively worked to promote science \& bring it closer to the general audience.

Schwartz said:
\begin{quotation}\it
	``What are mathematics helpful for? Mathematics are helpful for physics.
	
	Physics helps us make fridges.
	
	Fridges are made to contain spiny lobsters, \& spiny lobsters help mathematicians who eat them \& have hence better abilities to do mathematics, which are helpful for physics, which helps us make fridges which$\ldots$''[3]
\end{quotation}

\subsubsection{Entomology}
\textsf{\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clanis_schwartzi}{Clanis schwartzi} Paratype \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MHNT}{MHNT}.}

His mother, who was passionate about natural science, passed on her taste for \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entomology}{entomology} to Laurent.

His personal collection of 20,000 \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lepidoptera}{Lepidoptera} specimens, collected during his various travels was bequeathed to the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Museum_of_Natural_History_(France)}{Muséum national d'histoire naturelle}), the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mus%C3%A9e_des_Confluences}{Science Museum of Lyon}, the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mus%C3%A9um_de_Toulouse}{Museum of Toulouse} \& the Museo de Historia Natural Alcide d'Orbigny in \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cochabamba}{Cochabamba} (Bolivia).

Several species discovered by Schwartz bear his name.

\subsubsection{Personal ideology}
Apart from his scientific work, Schwartz was a well-known outspoken \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellectual}{intellectual}.

As a young socialist influenced by \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leon_Trotsky}{Leon Trotsky}, Schwartz opposed the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Totalitarianism}{}{totalitarianism} of the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union}{Soviet Union}, particularly under \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stalin}{Joseph Stalin}.

Schwartz ultimately rejected \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trotskyism}{Trotskyism} for \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_socialism}{democratic socialism}.

%
On his religious views, Schwartz called himself an atheist.[4]

\textit{Roger Meyer Temam} (born May 19, 1940) is a French applied mathematician working in \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_analysis}{numerical analysis}, \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonlinear_partial_differential_equations}{nonlinear partial differential equations} \& \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid_mechanics}{fluid mechanics}.

He graduated from the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Paris}{University of Paris} - the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorbonne}{Sorbonne} in 1967, completing a doctorate (\textit{thèse d'Etat}) under the direction of \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques-Louis_Lions}{Jacques-Louis Lions}.

He has published over 400 articles, as well as 12 (authored or co-authored) books.

\subsubsection{Scientific work}
The 1st work of Temam in his thesis dealt with the \textit{fractional steps method}.

Thereafter, ``he has continually explored \& developed new directions \& techniques'':[2]
\begin{itemize}
	\item \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus_of_variations}{calculus of variations}, \& the notion of \textit{duality} (book \#7), developing the mathematical framework for \textit{discontinuous} (in displacement) \textit{solutions}; a concept later used for his works on the \textit{mathematical theory of plasticity} (book \#5);
	\item mathematical formulation of the equilibrium of a plasma in a cavity, expressed as a nonlinear \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_boundary_problem}{free boundary problem};[R. Temam, A nonlinear eigenvalue problem: the shape at equilibrium of a confined plasma, \textit{Arch. Rational Mech. Anal.}, 60, 1975, 51--73.]
	\item \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korteweg-de_Vries_equation}{Korteweg-de Vries equation};[R. Temam, Sur un problème non linéaire, \textit{J. Math. Pures Appl.}, 48, 1969, 159--172.]
	\item \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuramoto%E2%80%93Sivashinsky_equation}{Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation};[5]
	\item \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler_equations}{Euler equations} in a bounded domain;[R. Temam, On the Euler equations of incompressible perfect fluids, \textit{J. Funct. Anal.}, 20, 1975, 32--43.]
	\item infinite-dimensional \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamical_systems}{dynamical systems} theory.
	
	In particular, he studied the existence of the finite-dimensional global \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attractor}{attractor} for many dissipative equations of mathematical physics, including the incompressible \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navier-Stokes_equations}{Navier-Stokes equations}.[P. Constantin, C. Foias, O. Manley \& R. Temam, Determining modes \& fractal dimension of turbulent flows, \textit{J. Fluid Mech.}, 150, 1985, 427--440.][C. Foias, O.P. Manley \& R. Temam, Physical estimates of the number of degrees of freedom in free convection, \textit{Phys. Fluids}, 29, 1986, 3101--3103.]
	
	He was also the co-founder of the notion of \textit{inertial manifolds}[C. Foias, G.R. Sell \& R. Temam, Inertial manifolds for nonlinear evolutionary equations, \textit{J. Diff. Equ.}, 73, 1988, 309--353.] together with Ciprian Foias \& \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_R._Sell}{George R. Sell} \& of exponential attractors[A. Eden, C. Foias, B. Nicolaenko \& R. Temam, \textit{Exponential attractors for dissipative evolution equations}, Collection Recherches en Mathématiques Appliquées, Masson, Paris, \& John Wiley, England, 1994.] together with Alp Eden, Ciprian Foias \& Basil Nicolaenko;[2]
	\item \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimal_control}{optimal control} of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations as a tool for the \textit{control of turbulence};[F. Abergel \& R. Temam, On some control problems in fluid mechanics, \textit{Theoret. Comput. Fluid Dynamics}, 1, 1990, 303--325.]
	\item \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundary_layer}{boundary layer} phenomena for incompressible flows.[12]
\end{itemize}
Temam's main activities concern the study of \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geophysical_fluid_dynamics}{geophysical flows}, the atmosphere \& oceans.[2]

This started in the 1990s by collaboration with Jacques-Louis Lions \& Shouhong Wang.[J.L. Lions, R. Temam \& S.

\textit{Karl Theodor Wilhelm Weierstrass} (German: \textit{Weierstraß};[Duden. \textit{Das Aussprachewörterbuch}. 7. Auflage. Bibliographisches Institut, Berlin 2015, ISBN 978-3-411-04067-4] Oct 31, 1815 - Feb 19, 1897) was a German mathematician often cited as the \fbox{``\textit{father of modern \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_analysis}{analysis}}''}.

Despite leaving university without a degree, he studied mathematics \& trained as a school teacher, eventually teaching mathematics, physics, \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Botany}{botany} \& gymnastics.[Weierstrass, Karl Theodor Wilhelm. (2018). In Helicon (Ed.), \textit{The Hutchinson unabridged encyclopedia with atlas \& weather guide}. [Online]. Abington: Helicon. Available from: \href{http://libezproxy.open.ac.uk/login?url=https://search.credoreference.com/content/entry/heliconhe/weierstrass_karl_theodor_wilhelm/0?institutionId=292}{link} [Accessed Jul 8, 2018].]

He later received an honorary doctorate \& became professor of mathematics in Berlin.

%
Among many other contributions, Weierstrass formalized the definition of the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_function}{continuity of a function}, proved the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermediate_value_theorem}{intermediate value theorem} \& the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolzano-Weierstrass_theorem}{Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem}, \& used the latter to study the properties of continuous functions on closed bounded intervals.

\subsubsection{Biography}
Weierstrass was born in Ostenfelde, part of \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ennigerloh}{Ennigerloh}, \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Province_of_Westphalia}{Province of Westphalia}.[O'Connor, J. J.; Robertson, E. F. (October 1998). ``\textit{Karl Theodor Wilhelm Weierstrass}''. School of Mathematics \& Statistics, University of St Andrews, Scotland. Retrieved Sep 7, 2014.]

%
Weierstrass was the son of Wilhelm Weierstrass, a government official, \& Theodora Vonderforst.

His interest in mathematics began while he was a \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnasium_(Germany)}{gymnasium} student at the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnasium_Theodorianum}{Theodorianum} in \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paderborn}{Paderborn}.

He was sent to the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Bonn}{University of Bonn} upon graduation to prepare for a government position.

Because his studies were to be in the fields of law, economics, \& finance, he was immediately in conflict with his hopes to study mathematics.

He resolved the conflict by paying little heed to his planned course of study but continuing private study in mathematics.

The outcome was that he left the university without a degree.

He then studied mathematics at the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_M%C3%BCnster}{Münster Academy} (which was even then famous for mathematics) \& his father was able to obtain a place for him in a teacher training school in \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%BCnster}{Münster}.

Later he was certified as a teacher in that city.

During this period of study, Weierstrass attended the lectures of \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christoph_Gudermann}{Christoph Gudermann} \& became interested in \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_function}{elliptic functions}.

%
In 1843 he taught in \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wa%C5%82cz}{Deutsch Krone} in \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Prussia}{West Prussia} \& since 1848 he taught at the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collegium_Hosianum}{Lyceum Hosianum} in \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braunsberg}{Braunsberg}.

Besides mathematics he also taught physics, botany, \& gymnastics.[3]

%
Weierstrass may have had an illegitimate child named Franz with the widow of his friend \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Wilhelm_Borchardt}{Carl Wilhelm Borchardt}.[Biermann, Kurt-R.; Schubring, Gert (1996). ``Einige Nachträge zur Biographie von Karl Weierstraß. (German) [Some postscripts to the biography of Karl Weierstrass]''. \textit{History of mathematics}. San Diego, CA: Academic Press. pp. 65--91.]

%
After 1850 Weierstrass suffered from a long period of illness, but was able to publish mathematical articles that brought him fame \& distinction.

The \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_K%C3%B6nigsberg}{University of Königsberg} conferred an \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honorary_doctor%27s_degree}{honorary doctor's degree} on him on Mar 31, 1854.

In 1856 he took a chair at the \textit{Gewerbeinstitut} in Berlin (an institute to educate technical workers which would later merge with the \textit{Bauakademie} to form the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_University_of_Berlin}{Technical University of Berlin}).

In 1864 he became professor at the Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universität Berlin, which later became the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humboldt_University_of_Berlin}{Humboldt Universität zu Berlin}.

%
In 1870, at the age of 55, Weierstrass met \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sofia_Kovalevskaya}{Sofia Kovalevsky} whom he tutored privately after failing to secure her admission to the University.
They had a fruitful intellectual, but troubled personal, relationship that ``far transcended the usual teacher-student relationship''.

The misinterpretation of this relationship \& Kovalevsky's early death in 1891 was said to have contributed to Weierstrass' later ill-health.

He was immobile for the last 3 years of his life, \& died in Berlin from \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pneumonia}{pneumonia}.[\textit{Dictionary of scientific biography}. Gillispie, Charles Coulston,, American Council of Learned Societies. New York. p. 223. ISBN 978-0-684-12926-6. OCLC 89822.]

\subsubsection{Mathematical contributions}

\paragraph{Soundness of calculus}
Weierstrass was interested in the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soundness}{soundness} of calculus, \& at the time there were somewhat ambiguous definitions of the foundations of calculus so that important theorems could not be proven with sufficient rigor.

Although \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernard_Bolzano}{Bolzano} had developed a reasonably rigorous definition of a \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limit_of_a_function}{limit} as early as 1817 (and possibly even earlier) his work remained unknown to most of the mathematical community until years later, \& many mathematicians had only vague definitions of \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limit_of_a_function}{limits} \& \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_function}{continuity} of functions.

%
The basic idea behind \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/(%CE%B5,_%CE%B4)-definition_of_limit}{Delta-epsilon} proofs is, arguably, 1st found in the works of \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustin-Louis_Cauchy}{Cauchy} in the 1820s.
\begin{itemize}
	\item Grabiner, Judith V. (March 1983), ``Who Gave You the Epsilon? Cauchy \& the Origins of Rigorous Calculus'' (PDF), \textit{The American Mathematical Monthly}, 90 (3): 185--194, doi:10.2307/2975545, JSTOR 2975545
	\item Cauchy, A.-L. (1823), ``Septième Leçon – Valeurs de quelques expressions qui se présentent sous les formes indéterminées $\frac{\infty}{\infty},\infty^0,\ldots$ Relation qui existe entre le rapport aux différences finies et la fonction dérivée'', \textit{Résumé des leçons données à l'école royale polytechnique sur le calcul infinitésimal}, Paris, archived from the original on 2009-05-04, retrieved 2009-05-01, p. 44.
\end{itemize}
Cauchy did not clearly distinguish between continuity \& uniform continuity on an interval.

Notably, in his 1821 \textit{Cours d'analyse}, Cauchy argued that the (pointwise) limit of (pointwise) continuous functions was itself (pointwise) continuous, a statement interpreted as being incorrect by many scholars.

The correct statement is rather that the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_limit}{uniform limit} of continuous functions is continuous (also, the uniform limit of uniformly continuous functions is uniformly continuous).

This required the concept of \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_convergence}{uniform convergence}, which was 1st observed by Weierstrass's advisor, \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christoph_Gudermann}{Christoph Gudermann}, in an 1838 paper, where Gudermann noted the phenomenon but did not define it or elaborate on it.

Weierstrass saw the importance of the concept, \& both formalized it \& applied it widely throughout the foundations of calculus.

%
The formal definition of continuity of a function, as formulated by Weierstrass, is as follows:
\begin{quotation}
	$f(x)$ is continuous at $x = x_0$ if $\forall\varepsilon > 0$, $\exists\delta > 0$ s.t. for every $x$ in the domain of $f$, $|x - x_0| < \delta\Rightarrow|f(x) - f(x_0)| < \varepsilon$.
	
	In simple English, $f(x)$ is continuous at a point $x = x_0$ if for each $x$ close enough to $x_0$, the function value $f(x)$ is very close to $f(x_0)$, where the ``close enough'' restriction typically depends on the desired closeness of $f(x_0)$ to $f(x)$.
\end{quotation}
Using this definition, he proved the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermediate_value_theorem}{Intermediate Value Theorem}.

He also proved the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolzano-Weierstrass_theorem}{Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem} \& used it to study the properties of continuous functions on closed \& bounded intervals.

\paragraph{Calculus of variations}
Weierstrass also made advances in the field of \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus_of_variations}{calculus of variations}.

Using the apparatus of analysis that he helped to develop, Weierstrass was able to give a complete reformulation of the theory that paved the way for the modern study of the calculus of variations.

Among several axioms, Weierstrass established a necessary condition for the existence of \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strong_extrema}{strong extrema} of variational problems.

He also helped devise the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weierstrass-Erdmann_condition}{Weierstrass-Erdmann condition}, which gives sufficient conditions for an extremal to have a corner along a given extremum \& allows one to find a minimizing curve for a given integral.
