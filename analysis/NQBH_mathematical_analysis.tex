Tôi được giải Nhì Giải tích Olympic Toán Sinh viên 2014 (VMC2014) khi còn học năm nhất Đại học \& được giải Nhất Giải tích Olympic Toán Sinh viên 2015 (VMC2015) khi học năm 2 Đại học. Nhưng điều đó không có nghĩa là tôi giỏi Giải tích. Bằng chứng là 10 năm sau khi nhận các giải đó, tôi đang tự học lại Giải tích Toán học với hy vọng có 1 hay nhiều cách nhìn mới mẻ hơn \& mang tính ứng dụng hơn cho các đề tài cá nhân của tôi.

``In mathematical analysis, a {\it $C_0$-semigroup}, also known as a {\it strongly continuous 1-parameter semigroup}, is a generalization of the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_function}{exponential function}. Just as exponential functions provide solutions of scalar linear constant ODEs, strongly continuous semigroups provide solutions of linear constant coefficient ODEs in \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banach_space}{Banach spaces}. Such differential equations in Banach spaces arise from e.g. \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delay_differential_equation}{delay differential equations} \& PDEs.

	``Differential geometry is the detailed study of the {\it shape} of a surface (manifold), including {\it local} \& {\it global} properties. A plane in $\mathbb{R}^3$ is a very simple surface \& does not require many tools to characterize. An ``arbitrarily'' shaped surface, e.g., hood of a car, has many distinguished geometric features (e.g., highly curved regions, regions of near flatness, etc.). Characterizing these features quantitatively \& qualitatively requires the tools of differential geometry. Geometric details are important in many physical \& biological processes, e.g., surface tension, biomembranes.
	
	The framework of differential geometry is built by 1st defining a local map (i.e., surface parameterization) which defines the surface. Then, a calculus framework is built up on the surface analogous to the standard ``Euclidean calculus''. Other approaches are also possible, e.g., those with implicit surfaces defined by level sets \& distance functions. But parameterizations, though arbitrary, are quite useful in a variety of settings $\Rightarrow$ stick mostly with those. Emphasize: The geometry of a surface does not depend on a particular parameterization. Otherwise, we will emphasize the distinction between {\tt object 1} \& {\tt object 2}.
	
	We will use this ``abuse'' of notation when there is no possibility of ambiguity.
	
	{\bf Open set.} The concept of open set is critical in multivariate calculus to properly define differentiability. The notation for referencing boundaries of sets, as well as the closure of sets, is practical for referencing geometric details of solid objects \& their surfaces.
	
	{\bf Compactness.} Compact support is useful for ignoring boundary effects. This concept is needed to keep the ``action of a function'' away from the boundary of a set, or to localize the function in a region of interest. 1 reason is to avoid potential difficulties with differentiating a function at its boundary of definition. Or, more commonly, we wish to ignore a quantity depending on the value of a function at a boundary point, e.g., $\int_{\partial S} f = 0$ if $f$ has compact support in $S$.
	
	{\bf Topological mapping{\tt/}homeomorphism.} A bijective, continuous mapping $\boldsymbol{\Phi}$ whose inverse $\boldsymbol{\Phi}^{-1}$ is also continuous is called a {\it topological mapping} or {\it homeomorphism}. Point sets that can be topologically mapped onto each other are said to be {\it homeomorphic}. Sets that are homeomorphic have the ``same topology'', i.e., their connectedness is the same; they have the same kinds of ``holes''. See \cite[Sect. 2.3.1]{Walker2015} for what can happen when a mapping is not a homeomorphism.
	
	{\bf Rigid motion mapping.} A mapping $\boldsymbol{\Phi}$ is called a {\it rigid motion} if any pair of points ${\bf a},{\bf b}$ are the same distance apart as the corresponding pair $\boldsymbol{\Phi}({\bf a}),\boldsymbol{\Phi}({\bf b})$.
	
	{\bf Orthogonal Transformations.} Define the (affine) linear map $\boldsymbol{\Phi}$ (transformation)
	\begin{equation}
		\label{transformation}
		\widetilde{\bf x} = \boldsymbol{\Phi}({\bf x}) = A{\bf x} + {\bf b}.
	\end{equation}
	If $A$ satisfies the properties $A^{-1} = A^\top$, $\det A = 1$ then $\boldsymbol{\Phi}$ represents a rigid motion. Basically, $\boldsymbol{\Phi}$ consists of a rotation represented by $A$ followed by a translation represented by ${\bf b}$. A rigid motion can be used to transition from 1 Cartesian coordinate system to another. If ${\bf b} = {\bf 0}$ \& $A^{-1} = A^\top$, $\det A = 1$, then $\boldsymbol{\Phi}({\bf x}) = A{\bf x}$ is a linear map known as a {\it direct orthogonal transformation}, which is nothing more than a rotation of the coordinate system with the origin as the center. If $A^{-1} = A^\top$, $\det A = 1$ is replaced by $A^{-1} = A^\top$, $\det A = -1$, then $\boldsymbol{\Phi}({\bf x}) = A{\bf x}$ is called an {\it opposite orthogonal transformation}, which consists of a rotation about the origin \& a reflection in a plane. Both $A^{-1} = A^\top$, $\det A = \pm1$ are examples of {\it orthogonal matrices}.
	
	{\bf Interpretation of transformations.} Can interpret $\widetilde{\bf x} = \boldsymbol{\Phi}({\bf x}) = A{\bf x} + {\bf b}$ in 2 different ways. Consider a point $P\in\mathbb{R}^3$ with coordinates ${\bf x}$:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item {\it Alias} (Euler perspective). Viewing \eqref{transformation} as a transformation of coordinates, it appears that ${\bf x},\widetilde{\bf x}$ are the coordinates of the same point w.r.t. 2 different coordinate systems, equivalently, the point is referenced by 2 different ``names'' (sets of coordinates).
		\item {\it Alibi} (Lagrange perspective). Viewing \eqref{transformation} as a mapping of sets, it appears that ${\bf x},\widetilde{\bf x}$ are the coordinates of 2 different points w.r.t. the same coordinate system, equivalently, the point at $\widetilde{\bf x}$ ``was previously'' at ${\bf x}$ before applying the map.
	\end{itemize}
	The concept of material point is directly related to the alibi viewpoint. One can think of a ``particle'' of material, i.e., {\it material point}, initially located at ${\bf x}$, that then moves to $\widetilde{\bf x}$ because of some physical process. The transformation \eqref{transformation} simply represents the kinematic outcome of that physical process, which is a standard concept in deformable continuum mechanics, especially nonlinear elasticity.
	
	{\bf General transformations.} In general, transformation may not be linear. The alias viewpoint yields a {\it curvilinear} coordinate system. The alibi viewpoint implies that the set $S$ is {\it deformed} into the set $S' = \boldsymbol{\Phi}(S)$. 
	
	{\bf Parametric approach -- what is a surface?} A {\it surface} is a set of points in space that is ``regular enough''. A random scattering of points in space does not match our intuitive notion of what a surface is, i.e., it is not regular enough. The boundary of a sphere does match our notion of a surface, i.e., regular enough to be a surface because a sphere is ``smooth''. {\it Intuition}: Can think of creating a surface as deforming a flat rubber sheet into a curved sheet. Let $U\subset\mathbb{R}^2$ be a ``flat'' domain \& let ${\bf X}:U\to\mathbb{R}^3$ be this deforming transformation, i.e., for each point $(s_1,s_2)^\top\in U$ there is a corresponding point ${\bf x} = (x_1,x_2,x_3)^\top\in\mathbb{R}^3$ s.t. ${\bf x} = {\bf X}(s_1,s_2)$. Let $\Gamma = {\bf X}(U)$ denote the surface obtained from ``deforming'' $U$. Call ${\bf x} = {\bf X}(s_1,s_2)$ a {\it parametric representation} of the surface $\Gamma$, where $s_1,s_2$ are called the {\it parameters} of the representation. Refer to $U$ as a {\it reference} domain.
	
	{\bf Allowable parameterization{\tt/}immersion.} If use ${\bf x} = {\bf X}(s_1,s_2)$ to define surfaces, then we must place assumptions on ${\bf X}$ to guarantee that $\Gamma = {\bf X}(U)$ is a valid surface. At the bare minimum, ${\bf X}$ must be continuous to avoid ``tearing'' the rubber sheet. But if want to perform calculus on $\Gamma$, need more:
	\begin{assumption}[Regularity assumptions on ${\bf X}$]
		An allowable parameterization{\tt/}immersion is a parameterization of the form ${\bf x} = {\bf X}(s_1,s_2)$ satisfying:
		\item[(A1)] The function ${\bf X}(s_1,s_2)\in C^\infty(U)$ \& each point ${\bf x} = {\bf X}(s_1,s_2)\in\Gamma$ corresponds to just 1 point $(s_1,s_2)\in U$, i.e., ${\bf X}$ is injective.
		\item[(A2)] The Jacobian matrix $J = [\partial_{s_1}{\bf X},\partial_{s_2}{\bf X}]$ is of rank $2$ on $U$, i.e., the columns of $J$ are linearly independent.
	\end{assumption}
	{\bf Regular surface.} The fundamental property that makes a set of points in $\mathbb{R}^3$ a surface is that it {\it locally looks like a plane} at every point. If you ``zoom into'' a surface, it should look flat. Definition defining a surface in terms of a parameterization is inadequate. Want to define a set in $\mathbb{R}^3$ that is ``intrinsically'' 2D \& is smooth enough so we can perform calculus on it, without regard to a specific parameterization.

\subsection{Calculus on Surfaces}
{\bf Goal.} Define \& develop the fundamental tools of calculus on a regular surface. Start with the notion of differentiability of functions defined only on a surface. Define the concept of vector fields in a surface. Then proceed to develop the gradient \& Laplacian operators w.r.t. a surface. These operators allow for alternative expressions of the summed \& Gaussian curvatures. Derive integration by parts on surfaces, i.e., the domain of integration is a surface. Conclude with some useful identities \& inequalities. Always take $\Gamma$: a regular surface, either with or without a boundary.

The point of view of integration defined as a Riemann integral may be historically grounded \& useful in many areas of mathematics but is far from being adequate for the requirements of modern analysis since Riemann integral can be defined only for a special class of functions \& this class is not closed under the process of taking pointwise limits of sequence (not even monotonic sequences) of functions in this class.

``The useful \& far-reaching idea of Lebesgue \& others was to compute the $(n + 1)$-dimensional volume `in the other direction' by 1st computing the $n$-dimensional volume of the set where the function $> y$. This volume is a well-behaved, monotone nonincreasing function of $y$, which then can be integrated in the manner of Riemann. This method of integration not only works for a large class of functions (which is closed under taking pointwise limits), but it also greatly simplifies a problem that used to plague analysts: {\it Is it permissible to exchange limits \& integration?}'' -- \cite[Chap. 1, pp. 1--2]{Lieb_Loss2001}

Lebesgue integration theory is 1 of the great triumphs of 20th century mathematics \& is the culmination of a long struggle to find the right perspective from which to view integration theory.

\subsection{Wikipedia{\tt/}mean-field game theory}
``{\it Mean-field game theory} is the study of strategic decision making by small interacting \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agent_(economics)}{agents} in very large populations. It lies at the intersection of \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_theory}{game theory} with stochastic analysis \& \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_theory}{control theory}. The use of the term ``mean field'' is inspired by \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean-field_theory}{mean-field theory} in physics, which considers the behavior of systems of large numbers of particles where individual particles have negligible impacts upon the system. In other words, each agent acts according to his minimization or maximization problem taking into account other agents' decisions \& because their population is large we can assume the number of agents goes to infinity \& a representative agent exists.

In traditional \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_theory}{game theory}, the subject of study is usually a game with 2 players \& discrete time space, \& extends the results to more complex situations by induction. However, for games in continuous time with continuous states (differential games or stochastic differential games) this strategy cannot be used because of the complexity that the dynamic interactions generate. On the other hand with MFGs we can handle large numbers of players through the mean representative agent \& at the same time describe complex state dynamics.

This class of problems was considered in the economics literature by \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boyan_Jovanovic}{Boyan Jovanovic} \& \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_W._Rosenthal}{Robert W. Rosenthal}, in the engineering literature by Minyi Huang, Roland Malhame, \& \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_E._Caines}{Peter E. Caines} \& independently \& around the same time by mathematicians Jean-Michel Lasry \& \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre-Louis_Lions}{Pierre-Louis Lions}.

In continuous time a mean-field game is typically composed of a \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamilton%E2%80%93Jacobi%E2%80%93Bellman_equation}{Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation} that describes the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimal_control}{optimal control} problem of an individual \& a \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fokker%E2%80%93Planck_equation}{Fokker--Planck equation} that describes the dynamics of the aggregate distribution of agents. Under fairly general assumptions it can be proved that a class of mean-field games is the limit as $N\to\infty$ of an $N$-player \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nash_equilibrium}{Nash equilibrium}.

A related concept to that of mean-field games is ``mean-field-type control''. In this case, a \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_planner}{social planner} controls the distribution of states \& chooses a control strategy. The solution to a mean-field-type control problem can typically be expressed as a dual adjoint Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation coupled with \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fokker%E2%80%93Planck_equation}{Kolmogorov equation}. Mean-field-type game theory is the multi-agent generalization of the single-agent mean-field-type control.

\subsubsection{General Form of a Mean-field Game}
The system of equations
\begin{equation*}
	\left\{\begin{split}
		-\partial_tu - \nu\Delta u + H(x,m,Du) &= 0,\\
		\partial_tm - \nu\Delta m - \nabla\cdot(D_pH(x,m,Du)m) &= 0,\\
		m(0) &= m_0,\\
		u(T,x) &= G(x,m(T)),
	\end{split}\right.
\end{equation*}
can be used to model a typical Mean-field game. The basic dynamics of this set of equations can be explained by an average agent's optimal control problem. In a mean-field game, an average agent can control their movement $\alpha$ to influence the population's overall location by
\begin{equation*}
	dX_t = \alpha_tdt + \sqrt{2\nu}dB_t,
\end{equation*}
where $\nu$: a parameter, $B_t$: a standard Brownian motion. By controlling their movement, the agent aims to minimize their overall expected cost $C$ throughout the time period $[0,T]$:
\begin{equation*}
	C = \mathbb{E}\left[\int_0^T L(X_s,\alpha_s,m(s))\,{\rm d}s + G(X_T,m(T))\right],
\end{equation*}
where $L(X_s,\alpha_s,m(s))$ is the running cost at time $s$ \& $G(X_T,m(T))$ is the terminal cost at time $T$. By this definition, at time $t$ \& position $x$, the value function $u(t,x)$ can be determined as
\begin{equation*}
	u(t,x) = \inf_\alpha \mathbb{E}\left[\int_t^T L(X_s,\alpha_s,m(s))\,{\rm d}s + G(X_T,m(T))\right].
\end{equation*}
Given the definition of the value function $u(t,x)$, it can be tracked by the Hamilton-Jacobi equation. The optimal action of the average players $\alpha^*(t,x)$ can be determined as $\alpha^*(t,x) = D_pH(x,m,Du)$. As all agents are relatively small \& cannot single-handedly change the dynamics of the population, they will individually adapt the optimal control \& the population would move in that way. This is similar to a Nash Equilibrium, in which all agents act in response to a specific set of others' strategies. The optimal control solution then leads to the Kolmogorov-Fokker-Planck equation $\partial_tm - \nu\Delta m - \nabla\cdot(D_pH(x,m,Du)m) = 0$.

\subsubsection{Finite State Games}
A prominent category of mean field is games with a finite number of states \& a finite number of actions per player. For those games, the analog of the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation is the Bellman equation, \& the discrete version of the Fokker-Planck equation is the Kolmogorov equation. Specifically, for discrete-time models, the players' strategy is the Kolmogorv equation's probability matrix. In continuous time models, players have the ability to control the transition rate matrix.

A discrete mean field game can be defined by a tuple $\mathcal{G} = (\mathcal{E},\mathcal{A},\{Q_a\},{\bf m}_0,\{c_a\},\beta)$ where $\mathcal{E}$ is the state space, $\mathcal{A}$ the action set, $Q_a$ the transition rate matrices, ${\bf m}_0$ the initial state, $\{c_a\}$ the cost functions \& $\beta\in\mathbb{R}$ a discount factor. Furthermore, a mixed strategy is a measurable function $\pi:\mathbb{R}^+\times\mathbb{E}\to\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{A})$, that associates to each state $i\in\mathcal{E}$ \& each time $t\ge0$ a probability measure $\pi_i(t)\in\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{A})$ on the set of possible actions. Thus $\pi_{i,a}(t)$ is the probability that, at time $t$ a player in state $i$ takes action $a$, under strategy $\pi$. Additionally, rate matrices $\{Q_a({\bf m}^\pi(t))\}_{a\in\mathcal{A}}$ define the evolution over the time of population distribution, where ${\bf m}^\pi(t)\in\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{E})$ is the population distribution at time $t$.

\subsubsection{Linear-quadratic Gaussian game problem}
From Caines (2009), a relatively simple model of large-scale games is the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear%E2%80%93quadratic%E2%80%93Gaussian_control}{linear-quadratic Gaussian} model. The individual agent's dynamics are modeled as a \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_differential_equation}{stochastic differential equation}
\begin{equation*}
	dX_i = (a_iX_i + b_iu_i)dt + \sigma_idW_i,\ i = 1,\ldots,N,
\end{equation*}
where $X_i$: the state of the $i$th agent, $u_i$: control of the $i$th agent, $W_i$: independent \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiener_process}{Wiener processes} $\forall i = 1,\ldots,N$. The individual agent's cost is
\begin{equation*}
	J_i(u_i,\nu) = \mathbb{E}\left[\int_0^\infty e^{-\rho t}[(X_i - \nu)^2 + ru_i^2]\,{\rm d}t\right],\ \nu = \Phi\left(\frac{1}{N}\sum_{k\ne i}^N X_k + \eta\right).
\end{equation*}
The coupling between agents occurs in the cost function.

\subsubsection{General \& Applied Use}
The paradigm of Mean Field Games has become a major connection between distributed decision-making \& stochastic modeling. Starting out tin the stochastic control literature, it is gaining rapid adoption across a range of applications, including:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item {\bf Financial market.} Carmona reviews applications in financial engineering \& economics that can be cast \& tackled within the framework of the MFG paradigm. Carmona argues that models in macroeconomics, contract theory, finance, $\ldots$, greatly benefit from the switch to continuous time from the more traditional discrete-time models. He considers only continuous time models in his review chapter, including systemic risk, price impact, optimal execution, models for bank runs, high-frequency trading, \& cryptocurrencies.
	\item {\bf Crowd motions.} MFG assumes that individuals are smart players which try to optimize their strategy \& path w.r.t. certain costs (equilibrium with rational expectations approach). MFG models are useful to describe the anticipation phenomenon: the forward part describes the crowd evolution while the backward gives the process of how the anticipations are built. Additionally, compared to multi-agent microscopic model computations, MFG only requires lower computational costs for the macroscopic simulations. Some researchers have turned to MFG in order to model the interaction between populations \& study the decision-making process of intelligent agents, including aversion \& congestion behavior between 2 groups of pedestrians, departure time choice of morning commuters, \& decision-making processes for autonomous vehicle.
	\item {\bf Control \& mitigation of Epidemics.} Since the epidemic has affected society \& individuals significantly, MFG \& mean-field controls (MFCs) provide a perspective to study \& understand the underlying population dynamics, especially in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic response. MFG has been used to extend the SIR-type dynamics with spatial effects or allowing for individuals to choose their behaviors \& control their contributions to the spread of the disease. MFC is applied to design the optimal strategy to control the virus spreading within a spatial domain, control individuals' decisions to limit their social interactions, \& support the government's nonpharmaceutical interventions.'' -- \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean-field_game_theory}{Wikipedia{\tt/}mean-field game theory}

``Avoiding the language of distributions, one starts with a differential equation \& rewrites it in such a way that no derivatives of the solution of the equation show up (the new form is called the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weak_formulation}{weak formulation}, \& the solutions to it are called {\it weak solutions}). Somewhat surprisingly, a differential equation may have solutions which are not differentiable; \& the weak formulation allows one to find such solutions.

Weak solutions are important because many differential equations encountered in modeling real-world phenomena do not admit of sufficiently smooth solutions, \& the only way of solving such equations is using the weak formulation. Even in situations where an equation does have differentiable solutions, it is often convenient to 1st prove the existence of weak solutions \& only alter show that those solutions are in fact smooth enough.'' -- \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weak_solution}{Wikipedia{\tt/}weak solution}

\begin{example}[1st-order wave equation]
	The 1st-order \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_equation}{wave equation} $\partial_tu + \partial_xu = 0$ in $\mathbb{R}^2$ with $u = u(t,x)$ has the weak form $\int_{\mathbb{R}^2} u\partial_t\varphi + u\partial_x\varphi\,{\rm d}t\,{\rm d}x = 0$ has a solution $u(t,x) = |t - x|$ which may be checked by splitting the integrals over region $\{x\ge t\}$ \& $\{x\le t\}$ where $u$ is smooth.
\end{example}
``The notion of weak solution based on distribution is sometimes inadequate. In the case of \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_system}{hyperbolic systems}, the notion of weak solution based on distributions does not guarantee uniqueness, \& it is necessary to supplement it with {\it entropy conditions} or some other selection criterion. In fully nonlinear PDE e.g. \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamilton%E2%80%93Jacobi_equation}{Hamilton-Jacobi equation}, there is a very different definition of weak solution called \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viscosity_solution}{\it viscosity solution}.'' -- \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weak_solution}{Wikipedia{\tt/}weak solution}

\subsubsection{General idea}
When solving a differential equation in $u$, one can rewrite it using a \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_function}{test function} $\varphi$ s.t. whatever derivatives in $u$ show up in the equation, they are ``transferred'' via integration by parts to $\varphi$, resulting in an equation without derivatives of $u$. This new equation generalizes the original equation to include solutions which are not necessarily differentiable. The approach illustrated above works in great generality. Consider a linear differential operator in an open set $W\subset\mathbb{R}^d$:
\begin{equation*}
	P({\bf x},\partial)u({\bf x}) = \sum a_\alpha({\bf x})\partial^\alpha u({\bf x}),
\end{equation*}
where the multi-index $\alpha = (\alpha_1,\ldots,\alpha_d)$ varies over some finite set in $\mathbb{N}^d$ \& the coefficients $a_\alpha$ are smooth enough functions of ${\bf x}\in\mathbb{R}^d$. The differential equation $P({\bf x},\partial)u({\bf x} = 0$ can, after being multiplied by a smooth test function $\varphi\in C_c^\infty(W)$ \& integrated by parts, be written as
\begin{equation*}
	\int_W u({\bf x})Q({\bf x},\partial)\varphi({\bf x})\,{\rm d}{\bf x} = 0,
\end{equation*}
where the differential operator $Q({\bf x},\partial)$ is given by the formula
\begin{equation*}
	Q({\bf x},\partial)\varphi({\bf x}) = \sum (-1)^{|\alpha|}\partial^\alpha[a_\alpha({\bf x})\varphi({\bf x})],
\end{equation*}
which is the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_adjoint}{formal adjoint} of $P({\bf x},\partial)$.

In summary, if the original (strong) problem was to find a $|\alpha|$-times differentiable function $u$ defined on the open set $W$ s.t. $P({\bf x},\partial)u({\bf x}) = 0$, $\forall{\bf x}\in W$ (a so-called {\it strong solution}), then an integrable function $u$ would be said to be a {\it weak solution} if $\int_W u({\bf x})Q({\bf x},\partial)\varphi({\bf x})\,{\rm d}{\bf x} = 0$, $\forall\varphi\in C_c^\infty(W)$.

\textit{Jacques-Louis Lions} ([1] 3 May 1928 - May 17, 2001) was a French mathematician who made contributions to the theory of \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_differential_equation}{partial differential equations} and to \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_processes}{stochastic control}, among other areas.

He received the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society_for_Industrial_and_Applied_Mathematics}{SIAM}'s \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_von_Neumann_Lecture}{John von Neumann Lecture} prize in 1986 and numerous other distinctions.[2][3]

Lions is listed as an \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISI_highly_cited_researcher}{ISI highly cited researcher}.[4] 

\subsubsection{Biography}
After being part of the French Résistance in 1943 and 1944, J.-L. Lions entered the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89cole_Normale_Sup%C3%A9rieure}{École Normale Supérieure} in 1947.

He was a professor of mathematics at the Université of Nancy, the Faculty of Sciences of Paris, and the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89cole_polytechnique}{École polytechnique}.

%
In 1966 he sent an invitation to \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gury_Marchuk}{Gury Marchuk}, the soviet mathematician to visit Paris.

This was hand delivered by \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_De_Gaulle}{General De Gaulle} during his visit to \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akademgorodok}{Akademgorodok} in June of that year.[5]

%
He joined the prestigious \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coll%C3%A8ge_de_France}{Collège de France} as well as the French Academy of Sciences in 1973.

In 1979, he was appointed director of the Institut National de la Recherche en Informatique et Automatique (\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INRIA}{INRIA}), where he taught and promoted the use of numerical simulations using finite elements integration.

Throughout his career, Lions insisted on the \textit{use of mathematics in industry}, with a particular involvement in the French space program, as well as in domains such as energy and the environment.

This eventually led him to be appointed director of the Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales (\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNES}{CNES}) from 1984 to 1992.

%
Lions was elected President of the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Mathematical_Union}{International Mathematical Union} in 1991 and also received the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan_Prize}{Japan Prize} and the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvey_Prize}{Harvey Prize} that same year.[3]

In 1992, the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Houston}{University of Houston} awarded him an honorary doctoral degree.

He was elected president of the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Academy_of_Sciences}{French Academy of Sciences} in 1996 and was also a Foreign Member of the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Society}{Royal Society} (ForMemRS)[6] and numerous other foreign academies.[2][3]

%
He has left a considerable body of work, among this more than 400 scientific articles, 20 volumes of mathematics that were translated into English and Russian, and major contributions to several collective works, including the 4000 pages of the monumental \textit{Mathematical analysis and numerical methods for science and technology} (in collaboration with Robert Dautray), as well as the \textit{Handbook of numerical analysis} in 7 volumes (with \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippe_G._Ciarlet}{Philippe G. Ciarlet}).

%
His son \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre-Louis_Lions}{Pierre-Louis Lions} is also a well-known mathematician who was awarded a \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fields_Medal}{Fields Medal} in 1994.[7]

Both father and son have received honorary doctorates from \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heriot-Watt_University}{Heriot-Watt University} in 1986 and 1995 respectively.[8]

	``He advocated a philosophy for applied mathematics research that involves the interaction of math theory, asymptotic modeling, numerical modeling, and observed and experimental data $\ldots$ Andy Majda's modus operandi of modern applied mathematics, as a symbiotic relationship between (i) rigorous mathematical theory, (ii) numerical analysis and numerical modeling, (iii) observed phenomena and experimental data, and (iv) qualitative and/or asymptotic modeling [Maj00].''

	``The period at UCLA was followed by 5 years at Berkeley, 1979--1984. During this productive time, he developed ``Majda's model'' for combustion in reactive flows, \& together with Tosio Kato \& Tom Beale derived ``Beale-Kato-Majda criterion,'' which characterizes a putative incompressible Euler singularity in terms of the accumulation of vorticity [BKM84].''
