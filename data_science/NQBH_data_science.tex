	{\sf About the Author.} {\sc Wes McKinney} is a Nashville-based software developer \& entrepreneur. After finishing his undergraduate degree in mathematics at MIT in 2007, he went on to do quantitative finance work at AQR Capital Management in Greenwich, CT. Frustrated by cumbersome data analysis tools, he learned Python \& started building what would later become {\tt pandas} project. He's now an active member of Python data community \& is an advocate for Python use in data analysis, finance, \& statistical computing applications.
	
	{\sc Wes} was later cofounder \& CEO of DataPad, whose technology assets \& team were acquired by Cloudera in 2014. He has since become involved in big data technology, joining Project Management Committees for Apache Arrow \& Apache Parquet projects in Apache Software Foundation. In 2018, he founded Ursa Labs, a not-for-profit organization focused Apache Arrow development, in partnership with RStudio \& 2 Sigma Investments. In 2021, he cofounded technology startup Voltron Data, where he currently works as Chief Technology Officer.
	
	``With this new edition, {\sc Wes} has updated his book to ensure it remains go-to resource for all things related to data analysis with Python \& pandas. I cannot recommend this book highly enough.'' -- {\sc Paul Barry}, Lecturer \& author of O'Reiley; {\it Head 1st Python}
	
	{\sc Wes McKinney}, cofounder \& chief technology officer of Voltron Data, is an active member of Python data community \& an advocate for Python use in data analysis, finance, \& statistical computing applications. A graduate of MIT, he's also a member of project management committees for Apache Software Foundation's Apache Arrow \& Apache Parquet projects.
	
	{\sf Preface.} 1e of this book was published in 2012, during a time when open source data analysis libraries for Python, especially pandas, were very new \& developing rapidly. When time came to write 2e in 2016--2017, needed to update book not only for Python 3.6 (1e used Python 2.7) but also for many changes in {\tt pandas} that had occurred over previous 5 years. 2022, there are fewer Python language changes (now at Python 3.10, with 3.11 coming out at end of 2022), but {\tt pandas} has continued to evolve.
	
	In 3e, goal: bring content up to date with current versions of Python, NumPy, pandas, \& other projects, while also remaining relatively conservative about discussing newer Python projects having appeared in last few years. Since this book has become an important resource for many university courses \& working professionals, try to avoid topics that are at risk of falling out of date within 1--2 year. That way paper copies won't be too difficult to follow in 2023 or 2024 or beyond.
	
	A new feature of 3e: open access online version hosted on website \url{https://wesmckinney.com/book}, to serve as a resource \& convenience for owners of print \& digital editions. Intend to keep content reasonably up to date there, so if you paper paper book \& run into sth that doesn't work properly, should check there for latest content changes.
	
	{\bf Using Code Examples.} Can find data files \& related material for each chap in this book's GitHub repository at \url{https://github.com/wesm/pydata-book}, which is mirrored to Gitee (for those who cannot access GitHub) at \url{https://gitee.com/wesmckinn/pydata-book}.
	
	This book is here to help get job done. In general, if example code is offered with this book, may use it in your programs \& documentation. Do not need to contact for permission unless you're reproducing a significant portion of code. E.g., writing a program that uses several chunks of code from this book does not require permission. Selling or distributing examples from O'Reilly books does not require permission. Answering a question by citing this book \& quoting example code does not require permission. Incorporating a significant amount of example code from this book into your product's documentation does require permission.
	
	{\bf Acknowledgments for 3e (2022).} $> 1$ decade since started writing 1e of this book \& $> 15$ years since originally started journey as a Python programmer. A lot has changed since then! Python has evolved from a relatively niche (ngách) language for data analysis to most popular \& most widely used language powering plurality (if not majority!) of DS, ML, \& AI work.
	
	Have not been an active contributor to {\tt pandas} open source project since 2013, but its worldwide developer community has continued to thrive, serving as a model of community-centric open source software development. Many ``next-generation'' Python projects that deal with tabular data are modeling their user interfaces directly after pandas, so project has proved to have an enduring influence on future trajectory of Python DS ecosystem.
	
	{\bf Acknowledgments for 2e (2017).} 5 years almost to day since completed manuscript for this book's 1e in Jul 2012. A lot has changed. Python community has grown immensely, \& ecosystem of open source software around it has flourished.
	
	This new edition of book would not exist if for tireless efforts of {\tt pandas} core developers, who have grown project \& its user community into 1 of cornerstones of Python DS ecosystem.
	
	With open source software projects more thinly resourced than ever relative to size of user bases, it is becoming increasingly important for businesses to provide support for development of key open source projects. It's the right thing to do.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item {\sf1. Preliminaries.}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item {\sf1.1. What Is This Book About?} This book is concerned with nuts \& bolts of manipulating, processing, cleaning, \& crunching (nhai giòn tan) data in Python. Goal: offer a guide to parts of Python programming language \& its data-oriented library ecosystem \& tools that will equip you to become an effective data analyst. While ``data analysis'' is in title of book, focus is specifically on Python programming, libraries, \& tools as opposed to data analysis methodology. This is Python programming you need {\it for} data analysis.
			
			Sometime after {\sc Wes} originally published this book in 2012, people started using term {\it data science} as an umbrella description for everything from simple descriptive statistics to more advanced statistical analysis \& ML. Python open source ecosystem for doing data analysis (or DS) has also expanded significantly since then. There are now many other books which focus specifically on these more advanced methodologies. Hope: this book serves as adequate preparation to enable you to move on to a more domain-specific resource.
			
			\begin{remark}
				Some might characterize much of content of book as ``data manipulation'' as opposed to ``data analysis.'' Also use terms \emph{wrangling} or \emph{munging} to refer to data manipulation.
			\end{remark}
			{\sf What Kinds of Data?} Primary focus is on {\it structured data}, a deliberately vague term that encompasses many different common forms of data, e.g.:
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Tabular or spreadsheet-like data in which each column may be a different type (string, numeric, date, or otherwise). This includes most kinds of data commonly stored in relational databases or tab- or comma-delimited text files.
				\item Multidimensional arrays (matrices).
				\item Multiple tables of data interrelated by key columns (what would be primary or foreign keys for a SQL user).
				\item Evenly or unevenly spaced time series.
			\end{itemize}
			This is by no means a complete list. Even though it may not always be obvious, a large percentage of datasets can be transformed into a structured form that is more suitable for analysis \& modeling. If not, it may be possible to extract features from a dataset into a structured form. E.g., a collection of news articles could be processed into a word frequency table, which could then be used to perform sentiment analysis.
			
			Most users of spreadsheet programs like Microsoft Excel, perhaps most widely used data analysis tool in the world, will not be strangers to these kinds of data.
			\item {\sf1.2. Why Python for Data Analysis?} For many people, Python programming language has strong appeal. Since its 1st appearance in 1991, Python has become 1 of most popular interpreted programming languages, along with Perl, Ruby, \& others. Python \& Ruby have become especially popular since 2005 or so for building websites using their numerous web frameworks, like Rails (Ruby) \& Django (Python). Such languages are often called {\it scripting} languages, as they can be used to quickly write small programs, or {\it scripts} to automate other tasks. I don't like term ``scripting languages,'' as it carries a connotation that they cannot be used for building serious software. Among interpreted languages, for various historical \& cultural reasons, Python has developed a large \& active scientific computing \& data analysis community. In last 20 years, Python has gone from a bleeding-edge or ``at your own risk'' scientific computing language to 1 of most important languages for DS, ML, \& general software development in academia \& industry.
			
			For data analysis \& interactive computing \& data visualization, Python will inevitably draw comparisons with other open source \& commercial programming languages \& tools in wide use, e.g. R, MATLAB, SAS, Stata, \& others. In recent years, Python's improved open source libraries (e.g. {\tt pandas} \& scikit-learn) have made it a popular choice for data analysis tasks. Combined with Python's overall strength for general-purpose software engineering, it is an excellent option as a primary language for building data applications.
			\begin{itemize}
				\item {\sf Python as Glue.} Part of Python's success in scientific computing: ease of integrating C, C++, \& FORTRAN code - -1 phần thành công của Python trong điện toán khoa học: dễ dàng tích hợp mã C, C++, \& FORTRAN. Most modern computing environments share a similar set of legacy FORTRAN \& C libraries for doing linear algebra, optimization, integration, fast Fourier transforms, \& other such algorithms. Same story has held true for many companies \& national labs that have used Python to glue together decades' worth of legacy software.
				
				Many programs consist of small portions of code where most of time is spent, with large amounts of ``glue code'' that doesn't run often. In many cases, execution time of glue code is significant; effort is most fruitfully invested in optimizing computational bottlenecks, sometimes by moving code to a lower-level language like C.
				\item {\sf Solving ``2-Language'' Problem.} In many organizations, common to research, prototype, \& test new ideas using a more specialized computing language like SAS or R \& then later port those ideas to be part of a larger production system written in, say, Java, C\#, or C++. What people are increasingly finding: Python is a suitable language not only for doing research \& prototyping but also for building production systems. {\it Why maintain 2 development environments when one will suffice?} Believe more \& more companies will go down this path, as there are often significant organizational benefits to having both researchers \& software engineers using same set of programming tools.
				
				Over last decade some new approaches to solving ``2-language'' problem have appeared, e.g. Julia programming language. Getting most out of Python in many cases {\it will} require programming in a low-level language like C or C++ \& creating Python bindings to that code. I.e., ``just-in-time'' (JIT) compiler technology provided by libraries like Numba have provided a way to achieve excellent performance in many computational algorithms without having to leave Python programming environment.
				\item {\bf Why Not Python?} While Python is an excellent environment for building many kinds of analytical applications \& general-purpose systems, there are a number of uses for which Python may be less suitable.
				
				As Python is an interpreted programming language, in general most Python code will run substantially slower than code written in a compiled language like Java or C++. As {\it programmer time} is often more valuable than {\it CPU time}, many are happy to make this trade-off. However, in an application with very low latency or demanding resource utilization requirements (e.g., a high-frequency trading systems), time spent programming in a lower-level (but also lower-productivity) language like C++ to achieve maximum possible performance might be time well spent.
				
				-- Vì Python là ngôn ngữ lập trình được thông dịch, nhìn chung hầu hết mã Python sẽ chạy chậm hơn đáng kể so với mã được viết bằng ngôn ngữ biên dịch như Java hoặc C++. Vì {\it thời gian lập trình} thường có giá trị hơn {\it thời gian CPU}, nhiều người vui vẻ chấp nhận sự đánh đổi này. Tuy nhiên, trong một ứng dụng có độ trễ rất thấp hoặc yêu cầu sử dụng tài nguyên khắt khe (ví dụ: hệ thống giao dịch tần suất cao), thời gian dành cho việc lập trình bằng ngôn ngữ cấp thấp hơn (nhưng cũng có năng suất thấp hơn) như C++ để đạt được hiệu suất tối đa có thể là thời gian được sử dụng hợp lý.
				
				Python can be a challenging language for building highly concurrent, multithreaded applications, particularly applications with many CPU-bound threads. Reason for this: it has what is known as {\it global interpreter lock} (GIL), a mechanism that prevents interpreter from executing $> 1$ Python instruction at a time. Technical reasons for why GIL exists are beyond scope of this book. While it is true that in many big data processing applications, a cluster of computers may be required to process a dataset in a reasonable amount of time, there are still situations where a single-process, multithreaded system is desirable.
				
				This is not to say: Python cannot execute truly multithreaded, parallel code. Python C extensions that use native mutithreading (in C or C++) can run code in parallel without being impacted by GIL, as long as they do not need to regularly interact with Python objects.
			\end{itemize}
			\item {\sf1.3. Essential Python Libraries.} For those who are less familiar with Python data ecosystem \& libraries used throughout book, a brief overview of some of them:
			\begin{itemize}
				\item {\sf NumPy.} \href{https://numpy.org}{NumPy}, short for Numerical Python, has long been a cornerstone of numerical computing in Python. It provides data structures, algorithms, \& library glue needed for most scientific applications involving numerical data in Python. {\tt NumPy} contains, among other things:
				\begin{itemize}
					\item A fast \& efficient multidimensional array object {\tt ndarray}
					\item Functions for performing element-wise computations with arrays or mathematical operations between arrays
					\item Tools for reading \& writing array-based datasets to disk
					\item Linear algebra operations, Fourier transform, \& random number generation
					\item A mature C API to enable Python extensions \& native C or C++ code to access NumPy's data structures \& computational facilities
				\end{itemize}
				Beyond fast array-processing capabilities that {\tt NumPy} adds to Python, 1 of its primary uses in data analysis is as a container for data to be passed between algorithms \& libraries. For numerical data, {\tt NumPy} arrays are more efficient for storing \& manipulating data than the other built-in Python data structures. Also, libraries written in a lower-level language, e.g. C or FORTRAN, can operate on data stored in a {\tt NumPy} array without copying data into some other memory representation. Thus, many numerical computing tools for Python either assume {\tt NumPy} arrays as a primary data structure or else target interoperability with NumPy.
				\item {\tt pandas.} \href{https://pandas.pydata.org}{pandas} provides high-level data structures \& functions designed to make working with structured or tabular data intuitive \& flexible. Since its emergence in 2010, it has helped enable Python to be a powerful \& productive data analysis environment. Primary objects in {\tt pandas} that will be used in this book are {\tt DataFrame}, a tabular, column-oriented data structure with both row \& column labels, \& {\tt Series}, a 1D labeled array object.
				
				{\tt pandas} blends array-computing ideas of {\tt NumPy} with kinds of data manipulation capabilities found in spreadsheets \& relationship databases (e.g. SQL). It provides convenient indexing functionality to enable you to reshape, slice \& dice, perform aggregations (thực hiện tổng hợp), \& select subsets of data. Since data manipulation, preparation, \& cleaning are such important skills in data analysis, {\tt pandas} is 1 of primary focuses of this book.
				
				As a bit of background, {\sc McKinney} started building {\tt pandas} in early 2008 during his tenure at AQR Capital Management, a quantitative investment management firm. At time, {\sc McKinney} had a distinct set of requirements that were not addressed by any single tool at his disposal:
				\begin{itemize}
					\item Data structures with labeled axes supporting automatic or explicit data alignment -- this prevents common errors resulting from misaligned data \& working with differently indexed data coming from different sources
					\item Integrated time series functionality
					\item Same data structures handle both time series data \& non-time series data
					\item Arithmetic operations \& reductions that preserve metadata
					\item Flexible handling of missing data
					\item Merge \& other relational operations found in popular databases (e.g., SQL-based)
				\end{itemize}
				Wanted to be able to do all of these things in 1 place, preferably in a language well suited to general-purpose software development. Python was a good candidate language for this, but at that time an integrated set of data structures \& tools providing this functionality did not exist. As a result of having been built initially to solve finance \& business analytics problems, {\tt pandas} features especially deep time series functionality \& tools well suited for working with time-indexed data generated by business processes.
				
				{\sc McKinney} spent a large part of 2011 \& 2012 expanding pandas's capabilities with some of former AQR colleagues, {\sc Adam Klein, Chang She}. In 2013, stopped being as involved in day-to-day project development, \& {\tt pandas} has since become a fully community-owned \& community-maintained project with well $> 2000$ unique contributors around world.
				
				For users of R language for statistical computing, {\tt DataFrame} name will be familiar, as object was named after similar R {\tt data.frame} object. Unlike Python, data frames are built into R programming language \& its standard library. As a result, many features found in {\tt pandas} are typically either part of R core implementation or provided by add-on packages.
				
				pandas name itself is derived from {\it panel data}, an econometrics term for multidimensional structured datasets, \& a play on phrase {\it Python data analysis}.
				\item {\sf matplotlib.} \href{https://matplotlib.org}{matplotlib} is most popular Python library for producing plots \& other 2D data visualizations. It was originally created by {\sc John D. Hunter} \& is now maintained by a large team of developers. It is designed for creating plots suitable for publication. While there are other visualization libraries available to Python programmers, matplotlib is still widely used \& integrates reasonably well with rest of ecosystem. Think it is a safe choice as a default visualization tool.
				\item {\tt IPython \& Jupyter.} \href{https://ipython.org}{IPython project} began in 2001 as {\sc Fernando P\'erez}'s side project to make a better interactive Python interpreter. Over subsequent 20 years it has become 1 of most important tools in modern Python data stack. While it does not provide any computational or data analytical tools by itself, IPython is designed for both interactive computing \& software development work. It encourages an {\it execute-explore} workflow instead of typical {\it edit-compile-run} workflow of many other programming languages. It also provides integrated access to OS's shell \& filesystem; this reduces need to switch between a terminal window \& a Python session in many cases. Since much of data analysis coding involves exploration, trial \& error, \& iteration, IPython can help you get job done faster.
				
				In 2014, {\sc Fernando} \& IPython team announced \href{https://jupyter.org}{Jupyter project}, a broader initiative to design language-agnostic interactive computing tools. IPython web notebook became Jupyter notebook, with support now for $> 40$ programming languages. IPython system can now be used as a {\it kernel} (a programming language mode) for using Python with Jupyter.
				
				IPython itself has become a component of much broader Jupyter open source project, which provides a productive environment for interactive \& exploratory computing. Its oldest \& simplest ``mode'' is as an enhanced Python shell designed to accelerate writing, testing, \& debugging of Python code. You can also use IPython system through Jupyter notebook.
				
				Jupyter notebook system also allows you to author content in Markdown \& HTML, providing you a means to create rich documents with code \& text.
				
				{\sc McKinney} personally uses IPython \& Jupyter regularly in Python work, whether running, debugging, or testing code.
				
				In \href{https://github.com/wesm/pydata-book}{accompanying book materials on GitHub}, you will find Jupyter notebooks containing all code examples from each chap. If cannot access GitHub where you are, can \href{https://gitee.com/wesmckinn/pydata-book}{try mirror on Gitee}.
				\item {\tt SciPy.} \href{https://scipy.org}{SciPy} is a collection of packages addressing a number of foundational problems in scientific computing. Some of tools it contains in its various modules:
				\begin{itemize}
					\item {\tt scipy.integrate}: Numerical integration routines \& differential equation solvers
					\item {\tt scipy.linalg}: Linear algebra routines \& matrix decompositions extending beyond those provided in {\tt numpy.linalg}
					\item {\tt scipy.optimize}: Function optimizers (minimizers) \& root finding algorithms
					\item {\tt scipy.signal}: Signal processing tools
					\item {\tt scipy.sparse}: Sparse matrices \& sparse linear system solvers
					\item {\tt scipy.special}: Wrapper around SPECFUN, a FORTRAN library implementing many common mathematical functions, e.g. {\tt gamma} function
					\item {\tt scipy.stats}: Standard continuous \& discrete probability distributions (density functions, samplers, continuous distribution functions), various statistical tests, \& more descriptive statistics
				\end{itemize}
				Together, {\tt NumPy} \& SciPy form a reasonably complete \& mature computational foundation for many traditional scientific computing applications.
				\item {\tt scikit-learn}: Since project's inception in 2007, \href{https://scikit-learn.org}{scikit-learn} has become premier general-purpose ML toolkit for Python programmers. As of this writing, $> 2000$ different individuals have contributed code to project. It includes submodels for such models as:
				\begin{itemize}
					\item Classification: SVM, nearest neighbors, random forest, logistic regression, etc.
					\item Regression: Lasso, ridge regression, etc.
					\item Clustering: $k$-means, spectral clustering, etc.
					\item Dimensionality reduction: PCA, feature selection, matrix factorization, etc.
					\item Model selection: Grid search, cross-validation, metrics
					\item Preprocessing: Feature extraction, normalization
				\end{itemize}
				Along with pandas, statsmodels, \& IPython, scikit-learn has been critical for enabling Python to be a productive DS programming language. While I won't be able to include a comprehensive guide to scikit-learn in this book, I will give a brief introduction to some of its models \& how to use them with other tools presented in book.
				\item \href{https://statsmodels.org}{\tt statsmodels} is a statistical analysis package that was seeded by work from Stanford University statistics professor {\sc Jonathan Taylor}, who implemented a number of regression analysis models popular in R programming language. {\sc Skipper Seabold \& Josef Perktold} formally created new statsmodels project in 2010 \& since then have grown project to a critical mass of engaged users \& contributors. {\sc Nathaniel Smith} developed Patsy project, which provides a formula or model specification framework for statsmodels inspired by R's formula system.
				
				Compared with scikit-learn, statsmodels contains algorithms for classical (primarily frequentist) statistics \& econometrics. This includes such submodules as:
				\begin{itemize}
					\item Regression models: linear regression, generalized linear models, robust linear models, linear mixed effect models, etc.
					\item Analysis of variance (ANOVA)
					\item Time series analysis: AR, ARMA, ARIMA, VAR, \& other models
					\item Nonparametric methods: Kernel density estimation, kernel regression
					\item Visualization of statistical model results
				\end{itemize}
				statsmodels is more focused on statistical inference, providing uncertainty estimates \& $p$-values for parameters. scikit-learn, by contrast, is more prediction focused.
				
				As with scikit-learn, give a brief introduction to statsmodels \& how to use it with {\tt NumPy} \& pandas.
				\item {\tt Other Packages.} In 2022, there are many other Python libraries which might be discussed in a book about DS. This includes some newer projects like TensorFlow or PyTorch, which have become popular for ML or AI work. Now that there are other books out there that focus more specifically on those projects, recommend using this book to build a foundation in general-purpose Python data wrangling. Then, you should be well prepared to move on to a more advanced resource that may assume a certain level of expertise.
			\end{itemize}
			\item {\sf1.4. Installation \& Setup.} Since everyone uses Python for different applications, there is no single solution for setting up Python \& obtaining necessary add-on packages. Many readers will not have a complete Python development environment suitable for following along with this book, so here give detailed instructions to get set up on each OS. Use Miniconda, a minimal installation of conda package manager, along with \href{https://conda-forge.org}{conda-forge}, a community-maintained software distribution based on conda. This book uses Python 3.10 throughout, but if read in future, welcome to install a newer version of Python.
			
			If for some reason these instructions become out-of-date by time you are reading this, can check \href{https://wesmckinney.com/book}{website for book} which I will endeavor to keep up to date with latest installation instructions.
			\begin{itemize}
				\item {\tt Miniconda on Windows.}
				\item {\tt GNU{\tt/}Linux.} Linux details will vary a bit depending on Linux distribution type, but here give details for such distributions as Debian, Ubuntu, CentOS, \& Fedora. Setup is similar to macOS with exception of how Miniconda is installed. Most readers will want to download default 64-bit installer file, which is for x86 architecture (but possible in future more users will have aarch64-based Linux machines). Installer is a shell script that must be executed in terminal. Then have a file named sth similar to \verb|Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh|. To install it, execute this script with {\tt bash}:
				\begin{verbatim}
					$ bash Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
				\end{verbatim}
				
				\begin{remark}
					Some Linux distributions have all required Python packages (although outdated versions, in some cases) in their package managers \& can be installed using a tool like {\tt apt}. Setup described here uses Miniconda, as it's both easily reproducible across distributions \& simpler to upgrade packages to their latest versions.
				\end{remark}
				Will have a choice of where to put Miniconda files. Recommend installing files in default location in home directory; e.g., \verb|/home/$USER/miniconda| (with your username, naturally).
				
				Installer will ask if wish to modify shell scripts to automatically activate Miniconda. Recommend doing this (select ``yes'') as a matter of convenience.
				
				After completing installation, start a new terminal process \& verify that you are picking up new Miniconda installation:
				\begin{verbatim}
					(base) nqbh@nqbh-dell:~/advanced_STEM_beyond/data_science$ python
					Python 3.12.7 | packaged by Anaconda, Inc. | (main, Oct  4 2024, 13:27:36) [GCC 11.2.0] on linux
					Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
					>>>
				\end{verbatim}
				To exit Python shell, type {\tt exit()} \& press Enter or press Ctrl-D.
				\item {\sf Miniconda on macOS.}
				\item {\sf Installing Necessary Packages.} Have set up Miniconda on system, time to install main packages will be using in this book. 1st step: configure {\tt conda-forge} as default package channel by running commands in a shell:
				\begin{verbatim}
					(base) $ conda config --add channels conda-forge
					(base) $ conda config --set channel_priority strict
				\end{verbatim}
				Now create a new conda ``environment'' with {\tt conda create} command using Python 3.10:

				Will be using some other packages, too, but these can be installed later once they are needed. There are 2 ways to install packages: with {\tt conda install} \& with {\tt pip install}. {\tt conda install} should always be preferred when using Miniconda, but some packages are not available through conda, so if \verb|conda install $package_name| fails, try \verb|pip install $package_name|.
				
				\begin{remark}
					If want to install all of packages used in rest of book, can do that now by running:

					\begin{question}[Downgrade NumPy]
						Why downgrade {\tt NumPy} version?
					\end{question}
					On Windows, substitute a carat \verb|^| for line continuation \verb|\| used on Linux \& macOS.
				\end{remark}	
				Can update packages by using {\tt conda update} command:
				\begin{verbatim}
					conda update package_name
				\end{verbatim}
				{\tt pip} also supports upgrades using {\tt--upgrade} flag:
				\begin{verbatim}
					pip install --upgrade package_name
				\end{verbatim}
				Have several opportunities to try out these commands throughout book.
				
				\begin{remark}
					While can use both {\tt conda} \& {\tt pip} to install packages, should avoid updating packages originally installed with conda using pip (\& vice versa), as doing so can lead to environment problems. Recommend sticking to conda if can \& falling back on pip only for packages that are unavailable with {\tt conda install}.
				\end{remark}
				\item {\sf Integrated Development Environments \& Text Editors.} When asked about standard development environment, almost always says ``IPython plus a text editor.'' Typically write a program \& iteratively test \& debug each piece of it in IPython or Jupyter notebooks. Also useful to be able to play around with data interactively \& visually verify that a particular set of data manipulations is doing right thing. Libraries like {\tt pandas} \& {\tt NumPy} are designed to be productive to use in shell.
				
				When building software, however, some users may prefer to use a more richly featured integrated development environment (IDE) \& rather than an editor like Emacs or Vim which provide a more minimal environment out of box. Some that you can explore:
				\begin{itemize}
					\item PyDev (free), an IDE built on Eclipse platform
					\item PyCharm from JetBrains (subscription-based for commercial users, free for open source developers)
					\item Python Tools for Visual Studio (for Windows users)
					\item Spyder (free), an IDE currently shipped with Anaconda
					\item Komodo IDE (commercial)
				\end{itemize}
				Due to popularity of Python, most text editors, like VS Code \& Sublime Text 2, have excellent Python support.
			\end{itemize}
			\item {\sf1.5. Community \& Conferences.} Outside of an internet search, various scientific \& data-related Python mailing lists are generally helpful \& responsive to questions. Some to take a look at include:
			\begin{itemize}
				\item pydata: A Google Group list for questions related to Python for data analysis \& pandas
				\item pystatsmodels: For statsmodels or pandas-related questions
				\item Mailing list for scikit-learn \verb|scikit-learn@python.org| \& ML in Python, generally
				\item numpy-discussion: For NumPy-related questions
				\item scipy-user: For general SciPy or scientific Python questions
			\end{itemize}
			Deliberately did not post URLs for these in case they change. They can be easily located via an internet search.
			
			Each year many conferences are held all over world for Python programmers. If would like to connect with other Python programmers who share interests, encourage to explore attending one, if possible. Many conferences have financial support available for those who cannot afford admission or travel to conference. Some to consider:
			\begin{itemize}
				\item PyCon \& EuroPython: 2 main general Python conferences in North America \& Europe, resp.
				\item SciPy \& EuroSciPy: Scientific-computing-oriented conferences in North America \& Europe, resp.
				\item SciPy \& EuroSciPy: Scientific-computing-oriented conferences in North America \& Europe, resp.
				\item PyData: A worldwide series of regional conferences a targeted at DS \& data analysis use cases
				\item International \& regional PyCon conferences (see \url{https://pycon.org} for a complete listing)
			\end{itemize}
			\item {\sf1.6. Navigating This Book.} If have never programmed in Python before, will want to spend some time in Chaps. 2--3, where have placed a condensed tutorial on Python language features \& IPython shell \& Jupyter notebooks. These things are prerequisite knowledge for remainder of book. If have Python experience already, may instead choose to skim or skip these chaps.
			
			Next, give a short introduction to key features of NumPy, leaving more advanced {\tt NumPy} use for Appendix A. Then, introduce {\tt pandas} \& devote rest of book to data analysis topics applying {\tt pandas, NumPy, matplotlib} (for visualization). Have structured material in an incremental fashion, though there is occasionally some minor crossover between chaps, with a few cases where concepts are used that haven't been introduced yet.
			
			While readers may have many different end goals for their work, tasks required generally fall into a number of different broad groups:
			\begin{itemize}
				\item {\it Interacting with outside world}: Reading \& writing with a variety of file formats \& data stores
				\item {\it Preparation}: Cleaning, munging, combining, normalizing, reshaping, slicing \& dicing, \& transforming data for analysis
				\item {\it Transformation}: Applying mathematical \& statistical operations to groups of datasets to derive new datasets (e.g., aggregating a large table by group variables)
				\item {\it Modeling \& computation}: Connecting your data to statistical models, ML algorithms, or other computational tools
				\item {\it Presentation}: Creating interactive or static graphical visualizations or textual summaries
			\end{itemize}
			
			\begin{itemize}
				\item {\sf Code Examples.} Most of code examples in book are shown with input \& output as it should appear executed in IPython shell or in Jupyter notebooks:
				\begin{verbatim}
					In [5]: CODE EXAMPLE
					Out[5]: OUTPUT
				\end{verbatim}
				When see a code example like this, intent is for you to type example code in {\tt In} block in your coding environment \& execute it by pressing {\tt Enter} key (or {\tt Shift-Enter} in Jupyter). Should see output similar to what is shown in {\tt Out} block.
				
				Changed default console output settings in {\tt NumPy} \& {\tt pandas} to improve readability \& brevity throughout book. E.g., may see more digits of precision printed in numeric data. To exactly match output shown in book, can execute following Python code before running code examples:
				\begin{verbatim}
					import numpy as np
					import pandas as pd
					pd.options.display.max_columns = 20
					pd.options.display.max_rows = 20
					pd.options.display.max_colwidth = 80
					np.set_printoptions(precision=4, suppress=True)
				\end{verbatim}
				\item {\sf Data Examples.} Datasets for examples in each chap are hosted in \url{https://github.com/wesm/pydata-book} (or in \url{https://gitee.com/wesmckinn/pydata-book} if cannot access GitHub). Can download this data either by using Git version control system on command line or by downloading a zip file of repository from website. If you run into problems, navigate to book website \url{https://wesmckinney.com/book} for up-to-date instructions about obtaining book materials.
				
				If download a zip file containing example datasets, must then fully extract contents of zip file to a directory \& navigate to that directory from terminal before proceeding with running book's code examples:
				\begin{verbatim}
					$ pwd
					/home/wesm/book-materials
					$ ls
					appa.ipynb ch05.ipynb ch09.ipynb ch13.ipynb  README.md
					ch02.ipynb ch06.ipynb ch10.ipynb COPYING     requirements.txt
					ch03.ipynb ch07.ipynb ch11.ipynb datasets
					ch04.ipynb ch08.ipynb ch12.ipynb examples
				\end{verbatim}
				Have made every effort to ensure: GitHub repository contains everything necessary to reproduce examples, but may have made some mistakes or omissions.
				\item {\sf Import Conventions.} Python community has adopted a number of naming conventions for commonly used modules:
				\begin{verbatim}
					import numpy as np
					import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
					import pandas as pd
					import seaborn as sns
					import statsmodels as sm
				\end{verbatim}
				I.e., when see {\tt np.arrange}, this is a reference to {\tt arrange} function in NumPy. This is done because it's considered bad practice in Python software development to import everything {\tt from numpy import *} from a large package like NumPy.
			\end{itemize}
		\end{itemize}
		\item {\sf2. Python Language Basics, IPython, \& Jupyter Notebooks.} When wrote 1e of this book in 2011--2012, there were fewer resources available for learning about doing data analysis in Python. This was partially a chicken-\&-egg problem; many libraries that we know take for granted, like {\tt pandas, scikit-learn, statsmodels}, were comparatively immature back then. Now in 2022, there is now a growing literature on DS, data analysis, \& ML, supplementing prior works on general-purpose scientific computing geared toward computational scientists, physicists, \& professionals in other research fields. There are also excellent books about learning Python programming language itself \& becoming an effective software engineer.
		
		As this book is intended as an introductory text in working with data in Python, feel valuable to have a self-contained overview of some of most important features of Python's built-in data structures \& libraries from perspective of data manipulation. So, will only present roughly enough information in Chaps. 2--3 to enable you to follow along with rest of book.
		
		Much of this book focuses on table-based analytics \& data preparation tools for working with datasets that are small enough to fit on your personal computer. to use these tools you must sometimes do some wrangling to arrange messy data into a more nicely tabular (or {\it structured}) form. Fortunately, Python is an ideal language for doing this. Greater your facility with Python language \& its built-in data types, easier it will be for you to prepare new datasets for analysis.
		
		Some of tools in this book are best explored from a live IPython or Jupyter session. Once learn how to start up IPython \& Jupyter session. Once learn how to start up IPython \& Jupyter, recommend: follow along with examples so can experiment \& try different things. As with any keyboard-driven console-like environment, developing familiarity with common commands is also part of learning curve.
		
		\begin{remark}
			There are introductory Python concepts that this chap does not cover, like classes \& object-oriented programming, which may find useful in your foray ()cuộc đột kích, cướp phá, xâm lược) into data analysis in Python.
			
			To deepen Python language knowledge, recommend: supplement this chap with \href{http://docs.python.org}{official Python tutorial} \& potentially 1 of many excellent books on general-purpose Python programming. Some recommendations to get you started include:
			\begin{itemize}
				\item {\it Python Cookbook}, 3e, by {\sc David Beazley, Brian K. Jones}
				\item {\it Fluent Python} by {\sc Luciano Ramalho}
				\item {\it Effective Python}, 2e, by {\sc Brett Slatkin}
			\end{itemize}
		\end{remark}
		
		\begin{itemize}
			\item {\sf2.1. Python Interpreter.} Python is an {\it interpreted} language. Python interpreter runs a program by executing 1 statement at a time. Standard interactive Python interpreter can be invoked on command line with {\tt python} command:
			\begin{verbatim}
				(pydata-book) nqbh@nqbh-dell:~$ python
				Python 3.12.7 | packaged by conda-forge | (main, Oct  4 2024, 16:05:46) [GCC 13.3.0] on linux                                                        
				Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.            
				>>>
			\end{verbatim}
			{\tt>>>} is {\it prompt} after which you'll type code expressions. To exit Python interpreter, can either type {\tt exit()} or press Ctrl-D (works on Linux \& macOS only).
			
			Running Python programs is as simple as calling {\tt python} with a {\tt.py} file as its 1st argument.
			
			While some Python programmers execute all of their Python code in this way, those doing data analysis or scientific computing make use of IPython, an enhanced Python interpreter, or Jupyter notebooks, web-based code notebooks originally created within IPython project. Give an introduction to using IPython \& Jupyter in this chap \& have included a deeper look at IPython functionality in Appendix A. When use \verb|%run| command, IPython executes code in specified file in same process, enabling to explore results interactively when it's done:
			\begin{verbatim}
				(pydata-book) nqbh@nqbh-dell:~$ ipython                            
				Python 3.12.7 | packaged by conda-forge | (main, Oct  4 2024, 16:05:46) [GCC 13.3.0]                                                                                Type 'copyright', 'credits' or 'license' for more information      
				IPython 8.31.0 -- An enhanced Interactive Python. Type '?' for help.                                                                                                In [1]: %run hello_world.py
				Hello world
				
				In [2]:
			\end{verbatim}
			Default IPython prompt adopts numbered {\tt In [2]:} style, cf. standard {\tt>>>} prompt.
			\item {\sf2.2. IPython Basics.} Run with IPython shell \& Jupyter notebook, \& introduce to some of essential concepts.
			\begin{itemize}
				\item {\sf Running IPython Shell.} Can launch IPython shell on command line just like launching regular Python interpreter except with {\tt ipython} command {\tt ipython}. You can execute arbitrary Python statements by typing them \& pressing Return (or Enter). When type just a variable into IPython, it renders a string representation of object:
				\begin{verbatim}
					In [5]: import numpy as np
					
					In [6]: data = [np.random.standard_normal() for i in range(7)]
					
					In [7]: data
					Out[7]: 
					[-0.960515015233981,
					0.29199995965351516,
					0.656773965407049,
					1.0319443387105414,
					-0.15623460611892206,
					-0.17214640580390445,
					0.5260760636382895]
				\end{verbatim}
				1st 2 lines are Python code statements; 2nd statement creates a variable named {\tt data} that refers to a newly created Python dictionary. Last line prints value of {\tt data} in console.
				
				Many kinds of Python objects are formatted to be more readable, or {\it pretty-printed}, which is distinct from normal printing with {\tt print}. If printed above {\tt data} variable in standard Python interpreter, it would be much less readable:
				\begin{verbatim}
					>>> import numpy as np
					>>> data = [np.random.standard_normal() for i in range(7)]
					>>> print(data)
					>>> data
					[-0.5767699931966723, -0.1010317773535111, -1.7841005313329152,
					-1.524392126408841, 0.22191374220117385, -1.9835710588082562,
					-1.6081963964963528]
				\end{verbatim}
				IPython also provides facilities to execute arbitrary blocks of code (via a somewhat glorified copy-\&-paste approach) \& whole Python scripts. Can also use Jupyter notebook to work with larger blocks of code.
				\item {\sf Running Jupyter Notebook.} 1 of major components of Jupyter project is {\it notebook}, a type of interactive document for code, text (including Markdown), data visualizations, \& other output. Jupyter notebook interacts with {\it kernels}, which are implementations of Jupyter interactive computing protocol specific to different programming languages. Python Jupyter kernel uses IPython system for its underlying behavior.
				
				To start up Jupyter, run command {\tt jupyter notebook} in a terminal:
				\begin{verbatim}

				On many platforms, Jupyter will automatically open in default web browser (unless start it with {\tt--no-browser}). Otherwise, can navigate to HTTP address printed when started notebook, here \url{http://localhost:8888/?token=0a77b52fefe52ab83e3c35dff8de121e4bb443a63f2d3055}. See {\sf Fig. 2.1: Jupyter notebook landing page} for what this looks like in Google Chrome.
				
				\begin{remark}
					Many people use Jupyter as a local computing environment, but it can also be deployed on servers \& accessed remotely. Won't cover those details here, but encourage to explore this topic on internet if it's relevant to your needs.
				\end{remark}
				To create a new notebook, click {\tt New} button \& select {\tt Python 3} option. Should see sth like {\sf Fig. 2.2: Jupyter new notebook view}. If this is 1st time, try clicking on empty code ``cell'' \& entering a line of Python code. Then press Shift-Enter to execute it.
				
				When save notebook (see {\tt Save \& Checkpoint} under notebook {\tt File} menu), it creates a file with extension {\tt.ipynb}: a self-contained file format containing all of content (including any evaluated code output) currently in notebook. These can be loaded \& edited by other Jupyter users.
				
				To rename an open notebook, click on notebook title at top of page \& type new title, pressing {\tt Enter} when finished.
				
				To load an existing notebook, put file in same directory where started notebook process (or in a subfolder within it), then click name from landing page. Can try it out with notebooks from {\tt wesm/pydata-book} repository on GitHub {\sf Fig. 2.3: Jupyter example view for an existing notebook}.
				
				When want to close a notebook, click File menu \& select {\tt Close \& Halt}. If simply close browser tab, Python process associated with notebook will keep running in background.
				
				While Jupyter notebook may feel like a distinct experience from IPython shell, nearly all of commands \& tools in this chap can be used in either environment.
				\item {\sf Tab Completion.} On surface, IPython shell looks like a cosmetically different version (phiên bản khác biệt về mặt thẩm mỹ) of standard terminal Python interpreter (invoked with {\tt python}). 1 of major improvements over standard Python shell is {\it tab completion}, found in many IDEs or other interactive computing analysis environments. While entering expressions in shell, pressing {\tt Tab} key will search namespace for any variables (objects, functions, etc.) matching characters you have typed so far \& show results in a convenient drop-down menu:
				\begin{verbatim}
					In [1]: an_apple = 27
					In [2]: an_example = 42
					In [3]: an<Tab>
					an_apple an_example  any
				\end{verbatim}
				Note: IPython displayed both of 2 variables I defined, as well as built-in function {\tt any}. Also, you can also complete methods \& attributes on any object after typing a period:
				\begin{verbatim}
					In [3]: b = [1, 2, 3]
					
					In [4]:  b.<Tab>
					append()  count()   insert()  reverse()
					clear()   extend()  pop()     sort()   
					copy()    index()   remove()           
				\end{verbatim}
				Same is true for modules:
				\begin{verbatim}
					In [1]:  import datetime
					
					In [2]: datetime.
					date          MAXYEAR       timedelta     UTC          
					datetime      MINYEAR       timezone                   
					datetime_CAPI time          tzinfo                     
				\end{verbatim}
				
				\begin{remark}
					IPython by default hides methods \& attributes starting with underscores, e.g. magic methods \& internal ``private'' methods \& attributes, in order to avoid cluttering display (\& confusing novice users -- gây bối rối cho người dùng mới!). These, too, can be tab-completed, but must 1st type an underscore to see them. If prefer to always see such methods in tab completion, can change this setting in IPython configuration. See \href{https://ipython.readthedocs.io}{IPython documentation} to find out how to do this.
				\end{remark}
				Tab completion works in many contexts outside of searching interactive namespace \& completng object or module attributes. When typing anything that looks like a file path (even in a Python string), pressing Tab key will complete anything on your computer's filesystem matching what you've typed.
				
				Combined with \verb|%run| command, this functionality can save you many keystrokes.
				
				Another area where tab completion saves time is in completion of function keyword arguments (including $=$ sign!) {\sf Fig. 2.4: Autocomplete function keywords in a Jupyter notebook}.
				
				Have a closer look at functions in a little bit:
				\item {\sf Introspection.} Using a question mark {\tt?} before or after a variable will display some general information about object:
				\begin{verbatim}
					In [12]: b?
					Type:        list
					String form: [1, 2, 3]
					Length:      3
					Docstring:  
					Built-in mutable sequence.
					
					If no argument is given, the constructor creates a new empty list.
					The argument must be an iterable if specified.
					
					In [13]: ?b
					Type:        list
					String form: [1, 2, 3]
					Length:      3
					Docstring:  
					Built-in mutable sequence.
					
					If no argument is given, the constructor creates a new empty list.
					The argument must be an iterable if specified.
					
					In [14]: print?
					Signature: print(*args, sep=' ', end='\n', file=None, flush=False)
					Docstring:
					Prints the values to a stream, or to sys.stdout by default.
					
					sep
					string inserted between values, default a space.
					end
					string appended after the last value, default a newline.
					file
					a file-like object (stream); defaults to the current sys.stdout.
					flush
					whether to forcibly flush the stream.
					Type:      builtin_function_or_method
				\end{verbatim}
				This is referred to as {\it object introspection}. If object is a function or instance method, docstring, if defined, will also be shown. Suppose we'd written following function (which you can reproduce in IPython or Jupyter):
				\begin{verbatim}
					def add_numbers(a, b):
					    """
					    Add two numbers together
					    Returns
					    -------
					    the_sum : type of arguments
					    """
					return a + b
				\end{verbatim}
				Then using {\tt?} shows us docstring:
				\begin{verbatim}
					In [6]: add_numbers?
					Signature: add_numbers(a, b)
					Docstring:
					Add two numbers together
					Returns
					-------
					the_sum : type of arguments
					File:    <ipython-input-9-6a548a216e27>
					Type:    function
				\end{verbatim}
				{\tt?} has a final usage, which is for searching IPython namespace in a manner similar to standard Unix or Windows command line. A number of characters combined with wildcard {\tt*} will show all names matching wildcard expression. E.g., could get a list of all functions in top-level NumPy namespace containing {\tt load}: [Missing line: {\tt np.loads} cf. book]
				\begin{verbatim}
					In [16]: import numpy as np
					
					In [17]: np.*load*?
					np.__loader__
					np.load
					np.loadtxt
				\end{verbatim}
