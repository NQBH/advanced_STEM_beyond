So I decided to solve this problem by ignoring it: I start with a general framework.

I hope that is not a joke. But if it is, then that joke is not funny to me.

Maybe more, but not less.

These computations seem boring, but still much better than my life.

I would say, computing adjoint equations & shape derivatives, even only with 1st-order, for turbulence models is something that everyone can/will know how to do it, but not many of them will do it.
